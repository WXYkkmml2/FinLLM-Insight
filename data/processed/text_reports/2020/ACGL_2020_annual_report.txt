For 2019 , we wrote $6.04 billion of net premiums and reported net income available to Arch common shareholders of $1.59 billion . Book value per share was $26.42 at December 31, 2019 , compared to $21.52 per share at December 31, 2018 . Arch Capitals registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda (telephone number: (441) 295-1422), and its principal executive offices are located at Waterloo House, Ground Floor, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda (telephone number: (441) 278-9250).

Our History Arch Capital was formed in September 2000 and became the sole shareholder of Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc. (Arch-U.S.) pursuant to an internal reorganization transaction completed in November 2000. In October 2001, Arch Capital launched an underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets that included the recruitment of new management teams and an equity capital infusion of $763.2 million which created a strong capital base that was unencumbered by significant pre-2002 risks. Since then, we have attracted a proven management team with extensive industry experience and enhanced our existing global underwriting platform for our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance and reinsurance businesses as described below. Our insurance underwriting platform initially consisted of Arch Insurance (Bermuda), a division of Arch Reinsurance Ltd. (Arch Re Bermuda), our Bermuda-based reinsurer and insurer, and our U.S.-licensed insurers, Arch Insurance Company (Arch Insurance), Arch Excess & Surplus Insurance Company (Arch E&S), Arch Specialty Insurance Company (Arch Specialty) and Arch Indemnity Insurance Company (Arch Indemnity). We established Arch Insurance (UK) Limited (Arch Insurance (U.K.)), our United Kingdom-based subsidiary, in 2004, and we expanded our North American presence when Arch Insurance opened a branch office in Canada in 2005. In 2013, Arch Insurance Canada Ltd. (Arch Insurance Canada), a Canada domestic company, commenced operations and replaced the branch office. In 2009, we established a managing agent and syndicate 2012 (Arch Syndicate 2012) at Lloyds of London (Lloyds) and in 2018, we acquired McNeil & Company, Inc. (McNeil), a U.S. nationwide leader in specialized risk management and program administration. We expanded our insurance platform in 2019 through two acquisitions. In January 2019 we acquired a book of U.K. commercial lines business from Ardonagh Group and are writing this business through Arch Insurance (U.K.) (Arch U.K. Regional Division). In November 2019, we completed the acquisition of Barbican Group Holdings Limited (Barbican Holdings), a Guernsey company, and its subsidiaries, including Barbican Managing Agency Limited (BMAL) and Lloyds Syndicate 1955 (Barbican Syndicate 1955). BMAL also provides Managing Agency services to Third Party Capital Syndicate 1856 (Arcus). Barbican Holdings also includes Castel Underwriting Agencies Limited (Castel) and other associated entities (collectively, Barbican). We also acquired U.K. commercial lines business from Ardonagh Group in January 2019, and this business is now written through Arch Insurance (U.K.) (Arch U.K. Regional Division). See OperationsInsurance Operations for further details on our insurance operations. Our reinsurance underwriting platform initially consisted of Arch Re Bermuda and Arch Reinsurance Company (Arch Re U.S.), our U.S.-licensed reinsurer. Our reinsurance operations ARCH CAPITAL 3 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents in Europe began in 2006 with the formation of a Swiss branch of Arch Re Bermuda, and the formation of a Danish underwriting agency in 2007. In addition to the U.S. reinsurance treaty activities of Arch Re U.S., we launched our property facultative reinsurance underwriting operations in 2007, which underwrite in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In 2008, we formed Arch Reinsurance Europe Designated Activity Company (Arch Re Europe), our Ireland-based reinsurance company, which replaced the Swiss branch. We launched treaty operations in Canada in 2011 and the following year we acquired the credit and surety reinsurance operations of Ariel Reinsurance Company Ltd. The acquisition of Barbican in November 2019 also contributed to our reinsurance operations. See OperationsReinsurance Operations for further details on our reinsurance operations. Our mortgage operations include U.S. and international mortgage insurance and reinsurance operations as well as participation in government sponsored enterprise (GSE) credit risk-sharing transactions. Formed in 2011, Arch Insurance (EU) Designated Activity Company (formerly, Arch Mortgage Insurance Designated Activity Company) (Arch Insurance (EU)), provides mortgage insurance products and services to the European market. Our mortgage platform was built through the acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company in 2014 (subsequently renamed Arch Mortgage Insurance Company). We further expanded our U.S. operations in 2016 through the acquisition of United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) (including United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company), from American International Group, Inc. (AIG). We acquired AIG United Guaranty Insurance (Asia) Limited (renamed Arch MI Asia Limited) from AIG in 2017. In January 2019, Arch LMI Pty Ltd (Arch LMI) was authorized by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to write lenders mortgage insurance on a direct basis in Australia. Our U.S. primary mortgage operations provide mortgage insurance products and services to the U.S. market. These operations include providers that are also approved as eligible mortgage insurers by Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), each a GSE. The mortgage operations also include participation in GSE credit risk-sharing transactions and direct mortgage insurance to U.S. mortgage lenders with respect to mortgages that lenders intend to retain in portfolio or include in non-agency securitizations along with mortgage reinsurance on a global basis. See OperationsMortgage Operations for further details on our mortgage operations. It is our belief that our underwriting platform, our experienced management team and our strong capital base have enabled us to establish a strong presence in the markets we participate in. In 2014 we acquired approximately 11% of Watford Holdings Ltd. Watford Holdings Ltd. is the parent of Watford Re Ltd., a multi-line Bermuda reinsurance company (together with Watford Holdings Ltd., Watford). In 2017, we acquired approximately 25% of Premia Holdings Ltd. Premia Holdings Ltd. is the parent of Premia Reinsurance Ltd., a multi-line Bermuda reinsurance company (together with Premia Holdings Ltd., Premia). See OperationsOther Operations for further details on Watford and Premia.

Arch Underwriting Agency (Australia) Pty. Ltd. is an Australian agency which also underwrites for Arch Syndicate 2012 and third parties. Strategy. Our insurance groups strategy is to operate in lines of business in which underwriting expertise can make a meaningful difference in operating results. The insurance group focuses on talent-intensive rather than labor-intensive business and seeks to operate profitably (on both a gross and net basis) across all of its product lines. To achieve these objectives, our insurance groups operating principles are to:  Capitalize on profitable underwriting opportunities . Our insurance group believes that its experienced management and underwriting teams are positioned to locate and identify business with attractive risk/reward characteristics. As profitable underwriting opportunities are identified, our insurance group will continue to seek to make additions to its product portfolio in order to take advantage of market trends. This includes adding underwriting and other professionals with specific expertise in specialty lines of insurance.  Centralize responsibility for underwriting . Our insurance group consists of a range of product lines. The underwriting executive in charge of each product line oversees all aspects of the underwriting product development process within such product line. Our insurance group believes that centralizing the control of such product line with the respective underwriting executive allows for close management of underwriting and creates clear accountability for results. Our U.S. insurance group has four regional offices, and the executive in charge of each region is primarily responsible for all aspects of the marketing and distribution of our insurance groups products, including the management of broker and other producer relationships in such executives respective region. In our non-U.S. offices, a similar philosophy is observed, with responsibility for the management of each product line residing with the senior underwriting executive in charge of such product line.  Maintain a disciplined underwriting philosophy . Our insurance groups underwriting philosophy is to generate an underwriting profit through prudent risk selection and proper pricing. Our insurance group believes that the key to this approach is adherence to uniform underwriting standards across all types of business. Our insurance groups senior management closely monitors the underwriting process.  Focus on providing superior claims management . Our insurance group believes that claims handling is an integral component of credibility in the market for insurance products. Therefore, our insurance group believes that its ability to handle claims expeditiously and satisfactorily is a key to its success. Our insurance group employs experienced claims professionals and also utilizes experienced external claims managers (third party administrators) where appropriate.  Promote and utilize an efficient distribution system . Our insurance group believes that promoting and utilizing a multi-channel distribution system, provides efficient access to its broad customer base. Our insurance group works with select international, national and regional retail and wholesale brokers and leading managing general agencies, including McNeil, to distribute our insurance ARCH CAPITAL 5 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents products. The Arch U.K. Regional Division expands our retail distribution network in the U.K.  Grow strategic partnerships in stable and niche areas. Our insurance group aims to build more integrated long-term alignment with strategic partners offering superior access to niche opportunities, quality scalable businesses, or lines with reliable defensive qualities. Our insurance group writes business on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. Our insurance group focuses on various specialty lines, as described in note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Underwriting Philosophy. Our insurance groups underwriting philosophy is to generate an underwriting profit (on both a gross and net basis) through prudent risk selection and proper pricing across all types of business. One key to this philosophy is the adherence to uniform underwriting standards across each product line that focuses on the following:  risk selection;  desired attachment point;  limits and retention management;  due diligence, including financial condition, claims history, management, and product, class and territorial exposure;  underwriting authority and appropriate approvals; and  collaborative decision making. Marketing. Our insurance groups products are marketed principally through a group of licensed independent retail and wholesale brokers. Clients (insureds) are referred to our insurance group through a large number of international, national and regional brokers and captive managers who receive from the insured or insurer a set fee or brokerage commission usually equal to a percentage of gross premiums. In the past, our insurance group also entered into contingent commission arrangements with some brokers that provided for the payment of additional commissions based on volume or profitability of business. Currently, some of our contracts with brokers provide for additional commissions based on volume. We have also entered into service agreements with select international brokers that provide access to their proprietary industry analytics. In general, our insurance group has no implied or explicit commitments to accept business from any particular broker and neither brokers nor any other third parties have the authority to bind our insurance group, except in the case where underwriting authority may be delegated contractually to select program administrators. Such administrators are subject to a due diligence financial and operational review prior to any such delegation of authority and ongoing reviews and audits are carried out as deemed necessary by our insurance group to assure the continuing integrity of underwriting and related business operations. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our CompanyWe could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents, general agents and other producers exceed their underwriting authorities or if our agents, our insureds or other third parties commit fraud or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. For information on major brokers, see note 17, Commitments and ContingenciesConcentrations of Credit Risk, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Risk Management and Reinsurance. In the normal course of business, our insurance group may cede a portion of its premium on a quota share or excess of loss basis through treaty or facultative reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our insurance group from its primary obligations to insureds. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, our insurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Our principal insurance subsidiaries, with oversight by a group-wide reinsurance steering committee (RSC), are selective with regard to reinsurers, seeking to place reinsurance with only those reinsurers which meet and maintain specific standards of established criteria for financial strength. The RSC evaluates the financial viability of its reinsurers through financial analysis, research and review of rating agencies reports and also monitors reinsurance recoverables and collateral with unauthorized reinsurers. The financial analysis includes ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments of reinsurers, including a review of the financial stability, appropriate licensing, reputation, claims paying ability and underwriting philosophy of each reinsurer. Our insurance group will continue to evaluate its reinsurance requirements. See note 7, Reinsurance, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For catastrophe-exposed insurance business, our insurance group seeks to limit the amount of exposure to catastrophic losses it assumes through a combination of managing aggregate limits, underwriting guidelines and reinsurance. For a discussion of our risk management policies, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting PronouncementsCeded Reinsurance and Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Claims Management. Our insurance groups claims management function is performed by claims professionals, as well as experienced external claims managers (third party administrators), where appropriate. In addition to investigating, evaluating and resolving claims, members of our insurance groups claims departments work with underwriting ARCH CAPITAL 6 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents professionals as functional teams in order to develop products and services desired by the groups clients. Reinsurance Operations Our reinsurance operations are conducted on a worldwide basis through our reinsurance subsidiaries, Arch Re Bermuda, Arch Re U.S. and Arch Re Europe. Arch Re Bermuda is a registered Class 4 insurer and long-term insurer and is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda. Arch Re U.S. is licensed or is an accredited or otherwise approved reinsurer in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada with its principal U.S. offices in Morristown, New Jersey. Treaty operations in Canada are conducted through the Canadian branch of Arch Re U.S. (Arch Re Canada). Arch Re U.S. is also an admitted insurer in Guam. Our property facultative reinsurance operations are conducted primarily through Arch Re U.S. The property facultative reinsurance operations have offices throughout the U.S., Canada and in Europe. Arch Re Europe, licensed and authorized as a non-life reinsurer and a life reinsurer, is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland with branch offices in Zurich and London. Strategy. Our reinsurance groups strategy is to capitalize on our financial capacity, experienced management and operational flexibility to offer multiple products through our operations. The reinsurance groups operating principles are to:  Actively select and manage risks . Our reinsurance group only underwrites business that meets certain profitability criteria, and it emphasizes disciplined underwriting over premium growth. To this end, our reinsurance group maintains centralized control over reinsurance underwriting guidelines and authorities.  Maintain flexibility and respond to changing market conditions . Our reinsurance groups organizational structure and philosophy allows it to take advantage of increases or changes in demand or favorable pricing trends. Our reinsurance group believes that its existing platforms in Bermuda, the U.S., Europe and Canada, broad underwriting expertise and substantial capital facilitate adjustments to its mix of business geographically and by line and type of coverage. Our reinsurance group believes that this flexibility allows it to participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability.  Maintain a low cost structure . Our reinsurance group believes that maintaining tight control over its staffing level and operating primarily as a broker market reinsurer permits it to maintain low operating costs relative to its capital and premiums. Our reinsurance group writes business on both a proportional and non-proportional basis and writes both treaty and facultative business. In a proportional reinsurance arrangement (also known as pro rata reinsurance, quota share reinsurance or participating reinsurance), the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured. The reinsurer pays the cedent a commission which is generally based on the cedents cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses) and may also include a profit factor. Non-proportional (or excess of loss) reinsurance indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a retention. Non-proportional business is written in layers and a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. The total coverage purchased by the cedent is referred to as a program. Any liability exceeding the upper limit of the program reverts to the cedent. The reinsurance groups treaty operations generally seek to write significant lines on less commoditized classes of coverage, such as specialty property and casualty reinsurance treaties. However, with respect to other classes of coverage, such as property catastrophe and casualty clash, the reinsurance groups treaty operations participate in a relatively large number of treaties where they believe that they can underwrite and process the business efficiently. The reinsurance groups property facultative operations write reinsurance on a facultative basis whereby they assume part of the risk under primarily single insurance contracts. Facultative reinsurance is typically purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties, for unusual risks or for amounts in excess of the limits on their reinsurance treaties. Our reinsurance group focuses on various specialty lines, as described in note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Underwriting Philosophy. Our reinsurance group employs a disciplined, analytical approach to underwriting reinsurance risks that is designed to specify an adequate premium for a given exposure commensurate with the amount of capital it anticipates placing at risk. A number of our reinsurance groups underwriters are also actuaries. It is our reinsurance groups belief that employing actuaries on the front-end of the underwriting process gives it an advantage in evaluating risks and constructing a high quality book of business. As part of the underwriting process, our reinsurance group typically assesses a variety of factors, including:  adequacy of underlying rates for a specific class of business and territory;  the reputation of the proposed cedent and the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedent, the geographic area in which the cedent does business, together with its catastrophe exposures, and our aggregate exposures in that area; ARCH CAPITAL 7 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents  historical loss data for the cedent and, where available, for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions, in order to compare the cedents historical loss experience to industry averages;  projections of future loss frequency and severity; and  the perceived financial strength of the cedent. Marketing. Our reinsurance group generally markets its reinsurance products through brokers, except our property facultative reinsurance group, which generally deals directly with the ceding companies. Brokers do not have the authority to bind our reinsurance group with respect to reinsurance agreements, nor does our reinsurance group commit in advance to accept any portion of the business that brokers submit to them. Our reinsurance group generally pays brokerage fees to brokers based on negotiated percentages of the premiums written through such brokers. For information on major brokers, see note 17, Commitments and ContingenciesConcentrations of Credit Risk, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Risk Management and Retrocession . Our reinsurance group currently purchases a combination of per event excess of loss, per risk excess of loss, proportional retrocessional agreements and other structures that are available in the market. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses on, and in certain cases may also increase the underwriting capacity of, our reinsurance group. Our reinsurance group will continue to evaluate its retrocessional requirements based on its net appetite for risk. See note 7, Reinsurance, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For catastrophe exposed reinsurance business, our reinsurance group seeks to limit the amount of exposure it assumes from any one reinsured and the amount of the aggregate exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any one geographic zone. For a discussion of our risk management policies, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting PronouncementsCeded Reinsurance and Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Claims Management. Claims management includes the receipt of initial loss reports, creation of claim files, determination of whether further investigation is required, establishment and adjustment of case reserves and payment of claims. Additionally, audits are conducted for both specific claims and overall claims procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies. Our reinsurance group makes use of outside consultants for claims work from time to time. Mortgage Operations Our mortgage operations provide U.S. and international mortgage insurance and reinsurance operations as well as participation in GSE credit risk-sharing transactions. Our mortgage group includes direct mortgage insurance in the U.S. primarily through Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (together, Arch MI U.S.); mortgage reinsurance primarily through Arch Re Bermuda to mortgage insurers on both a proportional and non-proportional basis globally; direct mortgage insurance in Europe through Arch Insurance (EU) and in Hong Kong through Arch MI Asia Limited (Arch MI Asia); and participation in various GSE credit risk-sharing products primarily through Arch Re Bermuda. In 2014 we completed the acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company from its owners, PMI Mortgage Insurance Co., (PMI) and CMFG Life Insurance Company (CUNA Mutual) and acquired PMIs mortgage insurance platform and related assets. CMG Mortgage Insurance Company was renamed Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and entered the U.S. mortgage insurance marketplace. Arch Mortgage Insurance Company is licensed and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of UGC and its primary operating subsidiary, United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, which is licensed and operates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company have each been approved as an eligible mortgage insurer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, subject to maintaining certain ongoing requirements (eligible mortgage insurer). Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company offers direct mortgage insurance to U.S. mortgage lenders with respect to mortgages that lenders intend to retain in portfolio or include in non-agency securitizations. Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, insures mortgages that are not intended to be sold to the GSEs, and it is therefore not approved by either GSE as an eligible mortgage insurer. Arch Insurance (EU) was licensed and authorized by the CBOI in 2011 to operate on a pan-European basis under the EUs freedom of establishment/freedom of services rules. Arch Underwriters Europe Limited (Arch Underwriters Europe), an Irish company authorized as an insurance and reinsurance intermediary by the CBOI, acts on behalf of Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Re Europe with branch offices in Italy, Switzerland, the U.K., and Finland. In 2017 we completed the acquisition of Arch MI Asia from AIG. In January 2019, Arch LMI was authorized by APRA to write lenders mortgage insurance. Arch LMI is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and focuses on providing direct lenders mortgage insurance to the Australian market. ARCH CAPITAL 8 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Strategy . The mortgage insurance market operates on a distinct underwriting cycle, with demand driven mainly by the housing market and general economic conditions. As a result, the creation of the mortgage group provides us with a more diverse revenue stream. Our mortgage groups strategy is to capitalize on its financial capacity, mortgage insurance technology platform, operational flexibility and experienced management to offer mortgage insurance, reinsurance and other risk-sharing products in the U.S. and around the world. Our mortgage groups operating principles and goals are to:  Capitalize on profitable underwriting opportunities . Our mortgage group believes that its experienced management, analytics and underwriting teams are positioned to identify and evaluate business with attractive risk/reward characteristics.  Maintain a disciplined credit risk philosophy . Our mortgage groups credit risk philosophy is to generate underwriting profit through disciplined credit risk analysis and proper pricing. Our mortgage group believes that the key to this approach is maintaining discipline across all phases of the applicable housing and mortgage lending cycles.  Provide superior and innovative mortgage products and services . Our mortgage group believes that it can leverage its financial capacity, experience across insurance product lines, and its analytics and technology to provide innovative products and superior service. The mortgage group believes that its delivery of tailored products that meet the specific, evolving needs of its customers will be a key to the groups success.  Maintain our position as a leading provider of U.S. mortgage insurance business . Prior to our 2014 acquisition, Arch Mortgage Insurance Company was the leading provider of mortgage insurance products and services to credit unions in the U.S. We broadened our customer base into national and regional banks and mortgage originators while maintaining and increasing our share of the mortgage insurance credit union market. With the acquisition of UGC in 2016, a leading provider of mortgage insurance products and services to national and regional banks and mortgage originators, we became a leading provider of U.S. mortgage insurance. Our mortgage group focuses on the following areas:  Direct mortgage insurance in the United States . Under their monoline insurance licenses, each of Archs eligible mortgage insurers may only offer private mortgage insurance covering first lien, one-to-four family residential mortgages. Nearly all of our mortgage insurance written provides first loss protection on loans originated by mortgage lenders and sold to the GSEs. Each GSEs Congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the principal balance of the mortgage is in excess of 80% of the value of the property securing the mortgage unless the excess portion of the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse, participation or by a qualified insurer. As a result, such high loan-to-value mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance protects the insured lender, investor or GSE against loss in the event of a borrowers default. If a borrower defaults on mortgage payments, private mortgage insurance reduces, and may eliminate, losses to the insured. Private mortgage insurance may also facilitate the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market because of the credit enhancement it provides. Our primary U.S. mortgage insurance policies predominantly cover individual loans and are effective at the time the loan is originated. We also may enter into insurance transactions with lenders and investors, under which we insure a portfolio of loans at or after origination. Although not currently a significant product, we may offer mortgage insurance on a pool basis in the future. Under pool insurance, the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans, typically for 100% of all contractual or policy-defined losses on every loan in the portfolio, subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit. Pool insurance may be in a first loss position with respect to loans that do not have primary mortgage insurance policies, or it may be in a second loss position, covering losses in excess of those covered by the primary mortgage insurance policy.  Direct mortgage insurance in Europe and other countries where we identify profitable underwriting opportunities . Since 2011, Arch Insurance (EU) has offered mortgage insurance to European mortgage lenders. Arch Insurance (EU)s mortgage insurance is primarily purchased by European mortgage lenders in order to reduce lenders credit risk and regulatory capital requirements associated with the insured mortgages. In certain European countries, lenders purchase mortgage insurance to facilitate regulatory compliance with respect to high loan-to-value residential lending. Arch Insurance (EU) offers mortgage insurance on both a flow basis to cover new originations and through structured transactions to cover one or more portfolios of previously originated residential loans. Following regulatory approval of Arch LMI in January 2019, we are also focused on expanding origination opportunities for lenders in Australia.  Reinsurance . Arch Re Bermuda provides quota share reinsurance covering U.S. and international mortgages. Such amounts include a quota share reinsurance agreement ARCH CAPITAL 9 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents with PMI pursuant to which it agreed to provide 100% quota share indemnity reinsurance to PMI for all certificates of insurance that were issued by PMI from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011 that were not in default as of an agreed upon effective date. Other than this quota share, no PMI legacy mortgage insurance exposures were assumed.  Other credit risk-sharing products . In addition to providing traditional mortgage insurance and reinsurance, we offer various credit risk-sharing products to government agencies and mortgage lenders. The GSEs have reduced their exposure to mortgage risk and continue to shift more of it to the private sector, creating opportunities for insurers to assume additional mortgage risk. In 2013, Arch Re Bermuda became the first (re)insurance company to participate in Freddie Macs program to transfer certain credit risk in its single-family portfolio to the private sector. Since that time, Arch Re Bermuda and its affiliates have regularly participated in both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac risk sharing programs. In 2015 we established Arch Mortgage Risk Transfer PCC Inc. (Arch MRT) a District of Columbia based protected cell captive insurer, licensed by District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking as a mortgage insurer. Arch MRT issues direct mortgage insurance to the GSEs through incorporated protected cells and cedes 100% of the risk to GSE approved reinsurers, including Arch Re U.S. Arch MRT entered into pilot transactions with both GSEs in 2018 and amended and extended both policies in 2019. In 2019 we established Arch Credit Risk Services (Bermuda) (ACRS) Ltd. ACRS is licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) as an insurance agent in Bermuda. ACRS offers mortgage credit assessment and underwriting advisory services with respect to participation in GSE credit risk transfer transactions. Underwriting Philosophy . Our mortgage group believes in a disciplined, analytical approach to underwriting mortgage risks by utilizing proprietary and third party models, including forecasting delinquency and future home price movements with the goal of ensuring that premiums are adequate for the risk being insured. Experienced actuaries and statistical modelers are engaged in analytics to inform the underwriting process. As part of the underwriting process, our mortgage group typically assesses a variety of factors, including the:  ability and willingness of the mortgage borrower to pay its obligations under the mortgage loan being insured;  characteristics of the mortgage loan being insured and the value of the collateral securing the mortgage loan;  financial strength, quality of operations and reputation of the lender originating the mortgage loan;  expected future home price movements which vary by geography;  projections of future loss frequency and severity; and  adequacy of premium rates. Sales and Distribution . We employ a sales force located throughout the U.S. to directly sell mortgage insurance products and services to our customers, which include mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. Our largest single mortgage insurance customer (including branches and affiliates) accounted for 4.0% and 4.7% of our gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other customer accounted for greater than 3.3% and 2.7% of the gross premiums written for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of gross premiums written on our top 10 customers was 20.8% and 20.9% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Europe, Asia, Bermuda and Australia, our products and services are/or will be distributed on a direct basis and through brokers. Each country represents a unique set of opportunities and challenges that require knowledge of market conditions and client needs to develop effective solutions. Risk Management . Exposure to mortgage risk is monitored globally and managed through underwriting guidelines, pricing, reinsurance, utilization of proprietary risk models, concentration limits and limits on net probable loss resulting from a severe economic downturn in the housing market. For a discussion of our risk management policies, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting PronouncementsCeded Reinsurance and Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our mortgage group has ceded a portion of its premium on a quota share basis through certain reinsurance agreements and through aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreements which provide reinsurance coverage for delinquencies on portfolios of in-force policies issued between certain periods. See note 7, Reinsurance, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details. Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our mortgage group from its primary obligations to insured parties. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, our mortgage subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, in addition to utilizing ARCH CAPITAL 10 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents reinsurance, we have developed a proprietary risk model that simulates the maximum loss resulting from severe economic events impacting the housing market. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCatastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events. Claims Management . With respect to our direct mortgage insurance business, the claims process generally begins with notification by the insured or servicer to us of a default on an insured loan. The insured is generally required to notify us of a default after the borrower misses two consecutive monthly payments. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit, rising interest rate levels and declining home prices. Upon notice of a default, in certain cases we may coordinate with loan servicers to facilitate and enhance retention workouts on insured loans. Retention workouts include loan modifications and other loan repayment options, which may enable borrowers to cure mortgage defaults and retain ownership of their homes. If a retention workout is not viable for a borrower, our loss on a loan may be mitigated through a liquidation workout option, including a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In the U.S., our master policies generally provide that within 60 days of the perfection of a primary insurance claim, we have the option of:  paying the insurance coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance multiplied by the loss amount;  in the event the property is sold pursuant to an approved prearranged sale, paying the lesser of (i) 100% of the loss amount less the proceeds of sale of the property, or (ii) the specified coverage percentage multiplied by the loss amount; or  paying 100% of the loss amount in exchange for the insureds conveyance to us of good and marketable title to the property, with us then selling the property for our own account. While we select the claim settlement option that best mitigates the amount of our claim payment, in the U.S. we generally pay the coverage percentage multiplied by the loss amount. Other Operations In 2014 we and HPS Investment Partners, LLC (formerly Highbridge Principal Strategies, LLC) (HPS), sponsored the formation of Watford. Arch Re Bermuda invested $100.0 million in Watford common shares and acquired approximately 11% of Watford as well as warrants to purchase up to 975,503 additional common shares. We also purchased $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Watford Holdings Ltds 6.5% senior notes in 2019. Watfords strategy is to combine a diversified reinsurance and insurance business with a disciplined investment strategy comprised primarily of non-investment grade credit assets. Watfords own management and board of directors are responsible for its results and profitability. Arch Re Bermuda has appointed two directors to serve on the eight person board of directors of Watford. See note 11, Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details. In 2017 we and Kelso & Company (Kelso) sponsored the formation of Premia. Premias strategy is to reinsure or acquire companies or reserve portfolios in the non-life property and casualty insurance and reinsurance run-off market. Arch Re Bermuda and certain Arch co-investors invested $100.0 million and acquired approximately 25% of Premia as well as warrants to purchase additional common equity. Arch Re Bermuda is providing a 25% quota share reinsurance treaty on certain business written by Premia, and subsidiaries of Arch Capital are providing certain administrative and support services to Premia, in each case pursuant to separate multi-year agreements. Arch Re Bermuda has appointed two directors to serve on the seven person board of directors of Premia. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Barbican entered into certain reinsurance and related transactions with Premia pursuant to which Premia assumed a transfer of liability for the 2018 and prior years of account of Barbican as of July 1, 2019. See note 15, Transactions with Related Parties, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details. Employees As of February 21, 2020, Arch Capital and its subsidiaries employed approximately 4,300 full-time employees. RESERVES Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (Loss Reserves) represent estimates of what the insurer or reinsurer ultimately expects to pay on claims at a given time, based on facts and circumstances then known, and it is probable that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates. Even actuarially sound methods can lead to subsequent adjustments to reserves that are both significant and irregular due to the nature of the risks written. Loss Reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. ARCH CAPITAL 11 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents For detail on our Loss Reserves by segment and potential variability in the reserving process, see the Loss Reserves section of Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 7. For an analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses and a reconciliation of the beginning and ending Loss Reserves and information about prior year reserve development, see note 5, Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For information on our reserving process, see note 6, Short Duration Contracts, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Unpaid and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable were approximately $4.35 billion at December 31, 2019 . For detail on our unpaid and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, see the Reinsurance Recoverables section of Financial Condition, Reinsurance Recoverables in Item 7. INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2019 , total investable assets held by Arch were $22.3 billion , excluding the $2.70 billion included in the other segment ( i.e. , attributable to Watford). Our current investment guidelines and approach stress preservation of capital, market liquidity and diversification of risk. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. While maintaining our emphasis on preservation of capital and liquidity, we expect our portfolio to become more diversified and, as a result, we may in the future expand into areas which are not part of our current investment strategy. For detail on our investments, see the Investable Assets Held by Arch section of Financial Condition in Item 7 and note 8, Investment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. RATINGS Our ability to underwrite business is affected by the quality of our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies. Such ratings from third party internationally recognized statistical rating organizations or agencies are instrumental in establishing the financial security of companies in our industry. We believe that the primary users of such ratings include commercial and investment banks, policyholders, brokers, ceding companies and investors. Insurance ratings are also used by insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers, and are often an important factor in the decision by an insured or intermediary of whether to place business with a particular insurance or reinsurance provider. The financial strength ratings of our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review as rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for ratings assigned to us by them. Such ratings may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of such ratings agencies in response to a variety of factors, including capital adequacy, management, earnings, forms of capitalization and risk profile. Periodically, rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for the ratings assigned to us by them. A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard & Poors (S&P) are ratings agencies which have assigned financial strength and/or issuer ratings to Arch Capital and/or one or more of its subsidiaries. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our Internet site ( www.ir.archcapgroup.com , under Credit Ratings) contains information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. COMPETITION The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we have and longer-term relationships with insureds and brokers than we have had. We compete with other insurers and reinsurers primarily on the basis of overall financial strength, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, geographic scope of business, strength of client relationships, premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered, speed of claims payment, reputation, employee experience, and qualifications and local presence. ARCH CAPITAL 12 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents In our insurance business, we compete with insurers that provide specialty property and casualty lines of insurance, including Alleghany Corporation, American Financial Group, Inc., American International Group, Inc., AXA XL, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Chubb Limited, CNA Financial Corp., Everest National Insurance Company, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance, Lloyds, Markel Insurance Company, RLI Corp., Sompo International, Tokio Marine HCC, The Travelers Companies, Inc., W.R. Berkley Corp. and Zurich Insurance Group. In our reinsurance business, we compete with reinsurers that provide property and casualty lines of reinsurance, including Alleghany Corporation, American International Group, Argo International Holdings, Ltd., AXA XL, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group Ltd., Hannover Rück SE, Lloyds, Markel Global Reinsurance, Munich Re Group, PartnerRe Ltd., RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., SCOR Global P&C, SCOR Global Life, Sompo International and Swiss Reinsurance Company. In our U.S. mortgage business, we compete with five active U.S. mortgage insurers, which include the mortgage insurance subsidiaries of Essent Group Ltd., Genworth Financial Inc., MGIC Investment Corporation, NMI Holdings Inc. and Radian Group Inc. The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Private mortgage insurers generally compete on the basis of underwriting guidelines, pricing, terms and conditions, financial strength, product and service offerings, customer relationships, reputation, the strength of management, technology, and innovation in the delivery and servicing of insurance products. Arch MI U.S. and other private mortgage insurers compete with federal and state government agencies that sponsor their own mortgage insurance programs. The private mortgage insurers principal government competitor is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and, to a lesser degree, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Future changes to the FHA program may impact the demand for private mortgage insurance. Arch MI U.S. and other private mortgage insurers increasingly compete with multi-line reinsurers and capital markets alternatives to private mortgage insurance. The GSEs continued their respective mortgage credit risk transfer (CRT) programs including the use of front and back-end transactions with multiline reinsurers. These transactions continue to create opportunities for multiline property casualty reinsurance groups and capital markets participants. The ongoing expansion of the GSEs risk transfer programs continue to attract additional reinsurers into the market with approximately 40 reinsurers now competing for business. For other U.S. risk sharing products and non-U.S. mortgage insurance opportunities, we have also seen increased competition from well capitalized and highly rated multiline reinsurers. It is our expectation that the depth and capacity of competitors from this segment will continue to increase over the next several years as more residential mortgage credit risk is borne by private capital. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT General. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a key element in our philosophy, strategy and culture. We employ an ERM framework that includes underwriting, reserving, investment, credit and operational risks. Risk appetite and exposure limits are set by our executive management team, reviewed with the Board and its committees and routinely discussed with business unit management. These limits are articulated in our risk appetite statement, which details risk appetite, tolerances and limits for each major risk category, and are integrated into our operating guidelines. Exposures are aggregated and monitored periodically by our corporate risk management team. The reporting, review and approval of risk management information is integrated into our annual planning process, capital modeling and allocation, reinsurance purchasing strategy and reviewed at insurance business reviews, reinsurance underwriting meetings and board level committees. Risk Management Process and Procedures. The following narrative provides an overview of our risk management framework and our methodology for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting on the key risks affecting us. It outlines our approach to risk identification and assessment and provides an overview of our risk appetite and tolerance for each of the following major risks: underwriting (insurance) risk including pricing, reserving and catastrophe; investment including market and liquidity risks; strategic risk; group risk including governance and capital market risk; credit risk; and operational risk, including regulatory, investor relations (reputational risk), rating agency and outsourcing risks. The framework includes details of our risk philosophy and policies to address the material risks confronting us; and compliance, approach and procedures to control and or mitigate these risks. The actions and policies implemented to meet our business management and regulatory obligations form the core of this framework. We have adopted a holistic approach to risk management by analyzing risk from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. Risk Identification and Assessment. The Finance, Investment and Risk Committee (FIR Committee), Audit Committee and Underwriting Oversight Committee of the Board oversee the top-down and bottom-up review of our risks. Given the nature and scale of our operations, these committees consider all aforementioned risks within the scope of the assessment. Arch Capitals Chief Risk Officer (CRO) assists these committees ARCH CAPITAL 13 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents in the identification and assessment of all key risks. The CRO is responsible for maintaining Arch Capitals risk register and continually reviewing and challenging risk assessments, including the impact of emerging risks and significant business developments. Board approval is required for any new high level risks or change in inherent or residual designations. Risk Monitoring and Control. Arch Capitals risk management framework requires risk owners to monitor key risks on a continuous basis. The highest residual risks are actively managed by the FIR Committee. The remaining risks are managed and monitored at a process level by the risk owners and/or the CRO. Risk owners have ultimate responsibility for the day-to-day management of each designated risk, reporting to the CRO on the satisfactory management and control of the risk and timely escalation of significant issues that may arise in relation to that risk. The CRO is responsible for overseeing the monitoring of all risks across the business and for communicating to the relevant risk owners if she becomes aware of issues, or potential and actual breaches of risk appetite, relevant to the assigned risks. A key element of these monitoring activities is the evaluation of our position relative to risk tolerances and limits approved by the Board. Risk Reporting. Quarterly, the CRO compiles the results of the key risk review process into a report to the FIR Committee for review and discussion at their quarterly meeting. The report includes an overview of selected key risks; a risk dashboard that depicts the status of risk limit and tolerance metrics; changes in the rating of high level risks in the Arch Capital risk register; and summaries of our largest exposures and reinsurance recoverables. If necessary, risk management matters reviewed at the FIR Committee meeting are presented for discussion by the Board. The CRO is responsible for immediately escalating any significant risk matters to executive management, the FIR Committee and/or the Board for approval of the required remediation. As part of our corporate governance, the Board and certain of its committees hold regular executive sessions with members of our management team. These sessions are intended to ensure an open and frank dialogue exists about various forms of risk across the organization. Implementation and Integration. We believe that an integrated approach to developing, measuring and reporting our Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) is an integral part of the risk management framework. The ORSA process provides the link between Arch Capitals risk profile, its board-approved risk appetite including approved risk tolerances and limits, its business strategy and its overall solvency requirements. The ORSA is the entirety of the processes and procedures employed to identify, assess, monitor, manage, and report the short- and long-term risks we face or may face and to determine the capital necessary to ensure that our overall solvency needs are met at all times. The ORSA also makes the link between actual reported results and the capital assessment. The ORSA is the basis for risk reporting to the Board and its committees and acts as a mechanism to embed the risk management framework within our decision making processes and operations. The Board has delegated responsibility for supervision and oversight of the ORSA to the FIR Committee. This oversight includes regular reviews of the ORSA process and output. An ORSA report is produced at least annually and the results of each assessment are reported to the Board. The Board actively participates in the ORSA process by steering how the assessment is performed and challenging its results. This assessment is also taken into account when formulating strategic decisions. The ORSA process and reporting are integral parts of our business strategy, tailored specifically to fit into our organizational structure and risk management system with the appropriate techniques in place to assess our overall solvency needs, taking into consideration the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business. We also take the results of the ORSA into account for our system of governance, including long-term capital management, business planning and new product development. The results of the ORSA also contributes to various strategic decision-making including how best to optimize capital management, establishing the most appropriate premium levels and deciding whether to retain or transfer risks. For further discussion of our risk management policies, see the Ceded Reinsurance section of Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 7. REGULATION General Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. We are subject to extensive regulation under applicable statutes in these countries and any other jurisdictions in which we operate. The current material regulations under which we operate are described below. We may become subject in the future to regulation in new jurisdictions or to additional regulations in existing jurisdictions. Bermuda General. Our Bermuda insurance operating subsidiary, Arch Re Bermuda, is a Class 4 general business insurer and a Class C long-term insurer, and is subject to the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (Insurance Act). The Insurance Act imposes certain solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, require information and demand the production of documents and intervene in the ARCH CAPITAL 14 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents affairs of insurance companies. Significant requirements include the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of a loss reserve specialist, the appointment of a principal representative in Bermuda, the filing of annual Statutory Financial Returns, the filing of annual financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the filing of an annual capital and solvency return, compliance with minimum and enhanced capital requirements, compliance with certain restrictions on reductions of capital and the payment of dividends and distributions, compliance with group solvency and supervision rules, if applicable, and compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct (relating to corporate governance, risk management and internal controls). Arch Re Bermuda must also comply with a minimum liquidity ratio and minimum solvency margin in respect of its general business. The minimum liquidity ratio requires that the value of relevant assets must not be less than 75% of the amount of relevant liabilities. The minimum solvency margin, which varies depending on the class of the insurer, is determined as a percentage of either net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) or premiums or pursuant to a risk-based capital measure. Arch Re Bermuda is also subject to an enhanced capital requirement (ECR) which is established by reference to either the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model (BSCR) or an approved internal capital model. The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining an insurers capital requirements (statutory capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurers business. The BMA has established a target capital level for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its enhanced capital requirement. While a Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its available statutory economic capital and surplus at this level, the target capital level serves as an early warning tool for the BMA, and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the target capital level will likely result in increased regulatory oversight. As a Class C insurer, Arch Re Bermuda is also required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus in respect of its long-term business at a level equal to or in excess of its long-term enhanced capital requirement which is established by reference to either the Class C BSCR model or an approved internal capital model. Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its general business or long-term business enhanced capital requirements, minimum solvency margins or its general business minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause such a breach. If it has failed to meet its minimum solvency margins or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, Arch Re Bermuda will be prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial years statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. Without the approval of the BMA, Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous years financial statements and any application for such approval must include an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins. The Insurance Amendment (No. 2) Act 2018 amended the Insurance Act to provide for the prior payment of policyholders liabilities ahead of general unsecured creditors in the event of the liquidation or winding up of an insurer. The amendments provide inter alia that, subject to certain statutorily preferred debts, the insurance debts of an insurer must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts of the insurer. Insurance debt is defined as a debt to which an insurer is or may become liable pursuant to an insurance contract excluding debts owed to an insurer under an insurance contract where the insurer is the person insured. Group Supervision . The BMA acts as group supervisor of our group of insurance and reinsurance companies (Group) and has designated Arch Re Bermuda as the designated insurer (Designated Insurer). As our Group supervisor, the BMA performs a number of functions including: (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information for other regulatory authorities; (ii) carrying out supervisory reviews and assessments of our Group; (iii) carrying out assessments of our Group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating, through regular meetings with other authorities, supervisory activities in respect of our Group; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against our Group or any Group members; and (vi) coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of these functions. As Designated Insurer, Arch Re Bermuda is required to facilitate compliance by our Group with the group insurance solvency and supervision rules. On an annual basis, the Group is required to file Group statutory financial statements, a Group statutory financial return, a Group capital and solvency return, audited Group financial statements, a Group Solvency Self-Assessment (GSSA), and a financial condition report with the BMA. The GSSA is designed to document our perspective on the capital resources necessary to achieve our business strategies and remain solvent, and to provide the BMA with insights on our risk management, governance procedures and documentation related to this process. In addition, the Designated Insurer is required to file quarterly group financial returns with the BMA. The Group is also required to maintain available Group statutory economic capital and surplus in an amount that is at least equal to the ARCH CAPITAL 15 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents group enhanced capital requirement (Group ECR) and the BMA has established a group target capital level equal to 120% of the Group ECR. The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all Bermuda registered insurers, and accordingly, any person who, directly or indirectly, becomes a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our ordinary shares must notify the BMA in writing within 45 days of becoming such a holder (or ceasing to be such a holder). The BMA may object to such a person and require the holder to reduce its holding of ordinary shares and direct, among other things, that voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares shall not be exercisable. Economic Substance Act. During 2017, the EUs Economic and Financial Affairs Council released a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The stated purpose of this list, and accompanying report, was to promote good governance worldwide in order to maximize efforts to prevent tax fraud and tax evasion. Bermuda was not on the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, but was referenced in the report (along with approximately 40 other jurisdictions) as having committed to address concerns relating to economic substance by December 31, 2018. In accordance with that commitment, Bermuda enacted the Economic Substance Act 2018 (as amended) of Bermuda and its related regulations (together, the ES Act). The ES Act came into force on January 1, 2019, and provides that a registered entity other than an entity which is resident for tax purposes in certain jurisdictions outside Bermuda (non-resident entity) that carries on as a business any one or more of the relevant activities referred to in the ES Act must comply with economic substance requirements. The list of relevant activities includes carrying on any one or more of the following activities: banking, insurance, fund management, financing, leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service center, intellectual property and holding entities. Under the ES Act, if a company is engaged in one or more relevant activities, it is required to maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda and to comply with the economic substance requirements set forth in the ES Act. A company will comply with those economic substance requirements if it: (a) is managed and directed in Bermuda; (b) undertakes core income generating activities (as may be prescribed under the ES Act) in Bermuda in respect of the relevant activity; (c) maintains adequate physical presence in Bermuda; (d) has adequate full time employees in Bermuda with suitable qualifications; and (e) incurs adequate operating expenditure in Bermuda in relation to the relevant activity undertaken by it. Companies that carry on insurance as a relevant activity are generally considered to operate in Bermuda with adequate substance, with respect to their insurance business, if they comply with the existing provisions of (a) the Companies Act 1981 relating to corporate governance; and (b) the Insurance Act 1978, that are applicable to the economic substance requirements, and the Registrar will have regard to such companies compliance with the Insurance Act 1978 (in addition to compliance with the Companies Act 1981) in his assessment of compliance with the economic substance requirements. That being said, such companies are still required to complete and file a Declaration Form, with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies and the Registrar will also have regard to the information provided in that Declaration Form in making his assessment of compliance with the ES Act. Bermuda National Pension Scheme. The National Pension Scheme (Occupational Pensions) Amendment Act 2019 (the NPS Amendment Act), the provisions of which come into force on different dates, amends the existing legislation and regulations requiring employers to establish, register fund and maintain occupational pension plans. The NPS Amendment Act contains extensive amendments to the National Pension Scheme (Occupational Pensions) Act 1998 (the NPS Act) as amended that enhance existing provisions and introduce new provisions including provisions relating to non-Bermudian employees, civil penalties, Guidance Notes and hardship benefits for persons who are retired. The NPS Amendment Act extends the requirement to provide an occupational pension plan to all employees meeting the eligibility criteria, with the exception of a person granted permission under the Bermuda Immigration and Protection Act 1956 to engage in gainful occupation in Bermuda for less than an aggregate period not exceeding twelve months, with effect from March 2, 2020. Historically and until such date, employers must only provide an occupational pension plan to Bermudians and the husband or wife of a Bermudian. United States General . Our U.S. based insurance operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they are domiciled, licensed and/or approved to conduct business. The insurance laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations. We currently have U.S. insurance and/or reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in Delaware, North Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas and the District of Columbia. State insurance regulation and supervision is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, marketing practices, claims practices, investments, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, certain aspects of governance, ERM, amounts we are required to hold as reserves for future payments, minimum capital and surplus requirements, annual and other report filings and transactions among affiliates. Our U.S. based subsidiaries are required to file detailed quarterly statutory financial statements with state insurance regulators. In addition, regulatory authorities conduct periodic financial, claims and market conduct examinations. Certain insurance ARCH CAPITAL 16 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents regulatory requirements are highlighted below. In addition to regulation applicable generally to U.S. insurance and reinsurance companies, our U.S. mortgage insurance operations are affected by federal and state regulation relating to mortgage insurers, mortgage lenders, and the origination, purchase and sale of residential mortgages. Arch Insurance (U.K.) is also subject to certain governmental regulation and supervision in the states where it writes excess and surplus lines insurance. Holding Company Regulation. All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. These regulations generally provide that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Notice to the state insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system and certain transactions may not be consummated without the applicable insurance departments prior approval or non-disapproval after receiving notice. The holding company acts also prohibit any person from directly or indirectly acquiring control of a U.S. insurance or reinsurance company unless that person has filed an application with specified information with such companys domiciliary commissioner and has obtained the commissioners prior approval. Under most states statutes acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, which, among other changes, introduce the concept of enterprise risk within an insurance holding company system. When the amendments are adopted by a particular state, the amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies and requiring a person divesting its controlling interest to make a confidential advance notice filing. Regulation of Dividends and Other Payments from Insurance Subsidiaries . The ability of an insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions is subject to insurance regulatory limitations of the insurers state of domicile. Such laws generally limit the payment of dividends or other distributions above a specified level. Dividends or other distributions in excess of such thresholds are extraordinary and are subject to prior notice and approval, or non-disapproval after receiving notice. Credit for Reinsurance. Arch Re U.S. is subject to insurance regulation and supervision that is similar to the regulation of licensed primary insurers. However, except for certain mandated provisions that must be included in order for a ceding company to obtain credit for reinsurance ceded, the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority. A primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its U.S. statutory-basis financial statements. As a result of the requirements relating to the provision of credit for reinsurance, and Arch Re U.S. and Arch Re Bermuda are indirectly subject to certain regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions in which ceding companies are domiciled. In general, credit for reinsurance is allowed if the reinsurer is licensed or accredited in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled; or if none of the above applies, to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately, typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer. Most states have adopted provisions of the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation that allow full credit to U.S. ceding insurers for reinsurance ceded to reinsurers that have been approved as certified reinsurers based upon less than 100% collateralization. Arch Re Bermuda is approved as a certified reinsurer in 35 states. In April 2018, the U.S. and the EU entered into the Bilateral Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on Prudential Matters Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance (the EU-US Covered Agreement) that, among other things, would eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU insurance market, and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified EU reinsurers operating in the U.S. insurance market. In December 2018, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative announced that they had reached agreement with the U.K. on a covered agreement (U.K. Covered Agreement) that would extend terms nearly identical to the EU Covered Agreement to insurers and reinsurers operating in the U.K. should the United Kingdom ultimately leave the EU. The NAIC has adopted amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation that would implement the EU-US Covered Agreement and the U.K. Covered Agreement and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified reinsurers domiciled in other jurisdictions deemed Reciprocal Jurisdictions.The NAIC has published a list of Reciprocal Jurisdictions that includes Bermuda, but it is possible that one or more states that adopt ARCH CAPITAL 17 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents the amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation may not accept Bermuda as a Reciprocal Jurisdiction. Risk Management and ORSA . In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAICs ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurers domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. If and when the ORSA Model Act is adopted by an individual state, the state may impose additional internal review and regulatory filing requirements on licensed insurers and their parent companies. Cybersecurity and Privacy . The NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which, when adopted by the states, will require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors. In addition, certain state insurance regulators are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements relating to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has adopted a regulation pertaining to cybersecurity for all banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction, effective as of March 1, 2017, which applies to us. Privacy legislation and regulation has also become an issue of increasing focus in many states. In addition, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018,(CCPA) which also applies to us, came into effect on January 1, 2020, and grants California consumers certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them subject to certain exceptions, as well as a private right of action with statutory penalties. Additional privacy laws expanding CCPA have already been proposed in California, and a range of new privacy laws are also under consideration in other states, as well as by the federal government. We cannot predict the impact these evolving laws and regulations may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations, but we could incur additional costs resulting from compliance with such laws and regulations. Risk-Based Capital Requirements . Licensed U.S. property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies are subject to risk-based capital requirements that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The risk-based capital model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and declines in asset values arising from investment risks. An insurer will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on how its statutory surplus compares to its risk-based capital calculation. Under the approved formula, an insurers total adjusted capital is compared to its authorized control level risk-based capital. If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no company or regulatory action is necessary. Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurers domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to risk-based capital requirement decreases. The mildest regulatory action requires an insurer to submit a plan for corrective action; the most severe requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated. Our mortgage insurance operations are not currently subject to state risk-based capital requirements, but rather are subject to state risk to capital or minimum policyholder position requirements. The NAIC has established a Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group which is engaged in developing changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurers Model Act, including the development of a risk based capital model unique to mortgage guaranty insurers. Guaranty Funds . Most states require all admitted insurance companies to participate in their respective guaranty funds which cover certain claims against insolvent insurers. Solvent insurers licensed in these states are required to cover the losses paid on behalf of insolvent insurers by the guaranty funds and are generally subject to annual assessments in the states by the guaranty funds to cover these losses. Mortgage guaranty insurance, among other lines of business, is typically exempt from participation in guaranty funds. Federal Regulation . Although state regulation is the dominant form of regulation for insurance and reinsurance business, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of Treasury, which is not a federal regulator or supervisor of insurance, but monitors the insurance industry for systemic risk, administers the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP), consults with the states regarding insurance matters and develops federal policy on aspects of international insurance matters. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Industry-We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism, cyber-attacks, ARCH CAPITAL 18 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents pandemics and political instability, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for more information on TRIP. In addition, FIO is authorized to assist the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in negotiating covered agreements between the U.S. and one or more foreign governments or regulatory authorities that address insurance prudential measures. Certain other federal laws also directly or indirectly impact mortgage insurers, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA), the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (HOPA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Truth In Lending Act (TILA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Among other things, these laws and their implementing regulations prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities, and require disclosures of the cost of credit and provide for other consumer protections. GSE Eligible Mortgage Insurer Requirements. GSEs impose requirements on private mortgage insurers so that they may be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs). The PMIERs apply to our eligible mortgage insurers, but do not apply to Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which is not GSE-approved. The PMIERs impose limitations on the type of risk insured, the forms and insurance policies issued, standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk, procedures for claims handling, acceptable underwriting practices, standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements, among other things. The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurers available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed minimum required assets as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value and original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans). Our eligible mortgage insurers satisfied the PMIERs financial requirements as of December 31, 2019 . Canada Arch Insurance Canada and Arch Re Canada are subject to federal, as well as provincial and territorial, regulation in Canada in the provinces and territories in which they underwrite insurance/reinsurance. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is the federal regulatory body that, under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), prudentially regulates federal Canadian and non-Canadian insurance and reinsurance companies operating in Canada. Arch Insurance Canada is licensed to carry on insurance business by OSFI and in each province and territory. Arch Re Canada is licensed to carry on reinsurance business by OSFI and in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), Arch Insurance Canada is required to maintain an adequate amount of capital in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Minimum Capital Test, and Arch Re Canada is required to maintain an adequate margin of assets over liabilities in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Branch Adequacy of Assets Test. OSFI has implemented a risk-based methodology for assessing insurance/reinsurance companies operating in Canada known as its Supervisory Framework. In applying the Supervisory Framework, OSFI considers the inherent risks of the business and the quality of risk management for each significant activity of each operating entity. Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), approval of the Minister of Finance (Canada) is required in connection with certain acquisitions of shares of, or control of, Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada, and notice to and/or approval of OSFI is required in connection with the payment of dividends by or redemption of shares by Canadian insurance companies such as Arch Insurance Canada. United Kingdom General . The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulate insurance and reinsurance companies and the FCA regulates firms carrying on insurance mediation activities operating in the U.K. both under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the FSMA). In May 2004, Arch Insurance (U.K.) (formerly Arch Insurance Company (Europe) Limited) was granted the relevant permissions for the classes of insurance business which it underwrites in the U.K. In 2009, AUAL was licensed and authorized by the relevant U.K. regulator and the Lloyds Franchise Board and holds the relevant permissions for the classes of insurance business which are underwritten in the U.K. by Arch Syndicate 2012. Arch Syndicate 2012 has one corporate member (the legal entity through which Funds at Lloyds are deposited), Arch Syndicate Investments Ltd. (ASIL). The Lloyds syndicates managed by BMAL have 11 corporate members. All U.K. companies are also subject to a range of statutory provisions, including the laws and regulations of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) (the U.K. Companies Act). The objectives of the PRA are to promote the safety and soundness of all firms it supervises and to secure an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders. The objectives of the FCA are to ensure customers receive financial services and products that meet their needs, to promote sound financial systems and markets and to ensure that firms are stable and ARCH CAPITAL 19 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents resilient with transparent pricing information and which compete effectively and have the interests of their customers and the integrity of the market at the heart of how they run their business. The PRA has responsibility for the prudential regulation of banks and insurers, while the FCA has responsibility for the conduct of business regulation in the wholesale and retail markets. The PRA and the FCA adopt separate methods of assessing regulated firms on a periodic basis. Arch Insurance (U.K.), AUAL and BMAL are subject to periodic assessment by the PRA along with all regulated firms. Arch Insurance (U.K.), AUAL and BMAL are subject to regulation by both the PRA and FCA. Castel is authorized and regulated by the FCA and is subject to periodic assessment and review by the FCA. Lloyds Supervision . The operations of AUAL (as managing agent of Arch Syndicate 2012) and BMAL (as managing agent of Barbican Syndicate 1955 and Arcus Syndicate 1856) and each syndicates respective corporate members, are subject to the byelaws and regulations made by (or on behalf of) the Council of Lloyds, and requirements made under those byelaws. The Council of Lloyds, established in 1982 by Lloyds Act 1982, has overall responsibility and control of Lloyds. Those byelaws, regulations and requirements provide a framework for the regulation of the Lloyds market, including specifying conditions in relation to underwriting and claims operations of Lloyds participants. Lloyds is also subject to the provisions of the FSMA. Lloyd's is authorized by the PRA and regulated by the PRA and FCA. Those entities acting within the Lloyds market are required to comply with the requirements of the FSMA and provisions of the PRAs or FCA's rules, although the PRA has delegated certain of its powers, including some of those relating to prudential requirements, to Lloyds. Each corporate member of Lloyds is required to contribute a percentage of the members premium income for each year of account to the Lloyds central fund. The Lloyds central fund is available if members of Lloyds assets are not sufficient to meet claims for which the member is liable. Each corporate member of Lloyds, may also be required to contribute to the central fund by way of a supplement to a callable layer of up to 3% of the corresponding members premium income limit for the relevant year of account. In addition, ASIL as a member of Arch Syndicate 2012, and Barbican Corporate Member Limited, as a member of Barbican Syndicate 1955, are each approved to underwrite excess and surplus lines insurance in most states in the U.S. through Lloyds licenses. Such activities must be in compliance with the Lloyds requirements. Financial Resources. The European solvency framework and prudential regime for insurers and reinsurers, the Solvency II Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II), took effect in full on January 1, 2016. See European UnionInsurance and Reinsurance Regulatory Regime below for additional details. Arch Insurance (U.K.), AUAL (on behalf of Arch Syndicate 2012) and BMAL (on behalf of Barbican Syndicate 1955) are currently required to meet economic risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II. Solvency II, together with European Commission delegated acts and guidance issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) sets out classification and eligibility requirements, including the features which capital must display in order to qualify as regulatory capital. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is a scheme established under FSMA to compensate eligible policyholders of insurance companies who may become insolvent. The FSCS is funded by the levies that it has the power to impose on all insurers. Arch Insurance (U.K.) could be required to pay levies to the FSCS. Restrictions on Acquisition of Control. Under FSMA, the prior consent of the PRA or FCA, as applicable, is required, before any person can become a controller or increase its control over any regulated company, including Arch Insurance (U.K.) and AUAL, or over the parent undertaking of any regulated company. Therefore, the PRA's or FCA's prior consent, as applicable, is required before any person can become a controller of Arch Capital. Prior consent is also required from Lloyds before any person can become a controller or increase its control over a corporate member or a managing agent or a parent undertaking of a corporate member or managing agent. A controller is defined for these purposes as a person who holds (either alone or in concert with others) 10% or more of the shares or voting power in the relevant company or its parent undertaking. Restrictions on Payment of Dividends . Under English law, all companies are restricted from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have profits available for distribution. The calculation as to whether a company has sufficient profits is based on its accumulated realized profits minus its accumulated realized losses. U.K. insurance regulatory laws do not prohibit the payment of dividends, but the PRA or FCA, as applicable, requires that insurance companies, insurance intermediaries and other regulated entities maintain certain solvency margins and may restrict the payment of a dividend by Arch Insurance (U.K.), BMAL and Castel. European Union Considerations . Following the referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voting U.K. citizens voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the EU and the approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by both the U.K. Parliament and the EU Parliament, the U.K. withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 (Brexit). The terms of Brexit are set forth in the Withdrawal Agreement and provide for a transition period of 11 months from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020 (unless a single extension of one to two years to this transition period is agreed between the U.K. government and the EU by June 30, 2020, although the U.K. government has indicated that ARCH CAPITAL 20 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents no extension will be sought) during which time the U.K. will remain in the EU customs union and single market (Transition Period). During the Transition Period, there will be no change in passporting rights for financial institutions in the U.K. This authorization enables Arch Insurance (U.K.) and AUAL to exercise passporting rights to establish a branch in any other Member State of the EU, where such entity will be subject to the insurance regulations of each such Member State with respect to the conduct of its business in such Member State, but remain subject only to the financial and operational supervision by the PRA or FCA (as applicable). Through their respective authorizations in the U.K., Arch Insurance (U.K.)s, AUALs, BMALs and Castels authorizations are currently recognized throughout the European Economic Area (EEA), subject only to certain notification and application requirements. The conditions for the establishment of branches in Member States of the EU are set out in Solvency II. Arch Insurance (U.K.) currently has branches in Germany, Italy, Spain and Denmark. During the Transition Period, through their passporting rights, our companies authorized in the U.K. will continue to have the freedom to provide insurance services anywhere in the EEA subject to compliance with certain rules governing such provision, including notification to the PRA or FCA, as applicable. Under our Brexit plan, from January 2020, all of the EU insurance business of Arch Insurance (U.K.) is conducted by Arch Insurance (EU). Unless the Transition Period is extended beyond December 31, 2020 (of which any single extension of one to two years must be agreed between the U.K. government and the EU by June 30, 2020), there will be a loss of passporting rights for financial institutions in the U.K., except to the extent that any aspect of the regime is preserved in a separate agreement between the EU and the U.K. The long-term implications of Brexit on the Solvency II framework in the U.K. are uncertain after the expiration of the Transition Period. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe U.K.s Withdrawal from the EU could adversely affect us. Ireland General . The CBOI regulates insurance and reinsurance companies and intermediaries authorized in Ireland. Our three Irish operating subsidiaries are Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe. Arch Re Europe was licensed and authorized by the CBOI as a non-life reinsurer in October 2008 and as a life reinsurer in November 2009. Arch Insurance (EU) was licensed and authorized by the CBOI as a non-life insurer in December 2011. As part of our Brexit planning, it was decided that Arch Insurance (EU) would became the platform for Arch's EU non-life insurance business. A change in business plan application was submitted to the CBOI and approval was received in February 2019. Arch Mortgage Insurance Designated Activity Company name was changed to Arch Insurance (EU) to reflect the expanded nature of the company's operations. Arch Underwriters Europe was registered by the CBOI as an insurance and reinsurance intermediary in July 2014. Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are subject to the supervision of the CBOI and must comply with Irish insurance acts and regulations as well as with directions and guidance issued by the CBOI. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are required to comply with Solvency II requirements. See European Union Insurance and Reinsurance Regulatory Regime below for additional details. As an intermediary, Arch Underwriters Europe is subject to a different regulatory regime and is not subject to solvency capital rules, but must comply with requirements such as to maintain professional indemnity insurance and to have directors that are fit and proper. Our Irish subsidiaries are also subject to the general body of Irish company laws and regulations including the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. Financial Resources. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are required to meet economic risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II. Solvency II, together with European Commission delegated acts and guidance issued by EIOPA sets out classification and eligibility requirements, including the features which capital must display in order to qualify as regulatory capital. Restrictions on Acquisitions. Under Irish law, the prior consent of the CBOI is required before any person can acquire or increase a qualifying holding in an Irish insurer or reinsurer, including Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Re Europe, or their parent undertakings. A qualifying holding is defined for these purposes as a direct or indirect holding that represents 10% or more of the capital of, or voting rights, in the undertaking or makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of the undertaking. Restrictions on Payment of Dividends . Under Irish company law, Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are permitted to make distributions only out of profits available for distribution. A companys profits available for distribution are its accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. Further, the CBOI has powers to intervene if a dividend payment were to lead to a breach of regulatory capital requirements. European Union Considerations . As Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe are authorized by the CBOI in Ireland, a Member State of the EU, those authorizations are recognized throughout the EEA. Subject only to certain notification and application requirements, Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe can provide services, or establish a branch, in any other Member State of the EEA. Although, in doing so, they may be subject ARCH CAPITAL 21 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents to the laws of such Member States with respect to the conduct of business in such Member State, company law registrations and other matters, they will remain subject to financial and operational supervision by the CBOI only. Arch Re Accident & Health ApS (Arch Re Denmark) is an underwriting agency underwriting accident and health business for Arch Re Europe in Denmark. Arch Re Europe also has a branch in the U.K., which underwrites non-life reinsurance risk for Arch Re Europe. Arch Re Europe also has a branch outside the EEA, Arch Reinsurance Europe Designated Activity Company, Dublin (Ireland), Zurich Branch (Arch Re Europe Swiss Branch). As part of its application for registration, Arch Underwriters Europe requested the CBOI to make the necessary notifications to permit it to provide insurance and reinsurance intermediary services in all EEA Member States. Arch Underwriters Europe currently has branches in the following EU countries: the U.K., Italy and Finland. Following Brexit and the end of the Transition Period, the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU will lead to a loss of passporting rights for EEA financial institutions (including our Irish operating subsidiaries) into the U.K., except to the extent that any aspect of the regime is preserved in a separate agreement between the EU and the U.K. Absent such agreement, the post-Brexit status and rules applicable to U.K. branches of EEA financial institutions will be primarily driven by U.K. law and regulation. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe U.K.s Withdrawal from the EU could adversely affect us. European Union Insurance and Reinsurance Regulatory Regime. Solvency II took effect in full on January 1, 2016. Solvency II imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all EU Member States and consists of three pillars: Pillar I-quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; Pillar II-qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process; and Pillar III-market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurers financial condition to regulators and the public. Solvency II is supplemented by European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (the Delegated Regulation), other European Commission delegated acts and binding technical standards, and guidelines issued by EIOPA. The Delegated Regulation sets out more detailed requirements for individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings, as well as for groups, based on the overarching provisions of Solvency II, which together make up the core of the single prudential rulebook for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. Following Brexit, the U.K.s withdrawal from the EU will lead to a loss of passporting rights from U.K. financial institutions into the EU, except to the extent that any aspect of the regime is preserved in a separate agreement between the U.K. and the EU. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe U.K.s Withdrawal from the EU could adversely affect us. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU), being established in Ireland and authorized by the CBOI are able, subject to similar regulatory notifications and there being no objection from the CBOI and the Member States concerned, to establish branches and provide reinsurance services, and, in respect of Arch Insurance (EU), insurance services in all EEA states. Solvency II does not prohibit EEA insurers from obtaining reinsurance from reinsurers licensed outside the EEA, such as Arch Re Bermuda. As such, and subject to the specific rules in each Member State, Arch Re Bermuda may do business from Bermuda with insurers in EEA Member States, but it may not directly operate its reinsurance business within the EEA. Article 172 of Solvency II provides that reinsurance contracts concluded by insurance undertakings in the EEA with reinsurers having their head office in a country whose solvency regime has been determined to be equivalent to Solvency II shall be treated in the same manner as reinsurance contracts with undertakings in the EEA authorized under Solvency II. In this regard, with effect from January 1, 2016, the supervisory regime, including the solvency regime, in Bermuda has been determined to be equivalent to that laid down in Solvency II, except in relation to captives and special purpose insurers. Solvency II also includes specific measures providing for the supervision of insurance and reinsurance groups. However, as a consequence of the above determination of equivalence, pursuant to Article 260 of Solvency II, regulators within the EEA are required to rely on the worldwide group supervision exercised by the BMA. EIOPA has also indicated that, on a case by case basis, groups subject to this worldwide supervision may be exempted from any EEA sub-group supervision, where this results in more efficient supervision of the group and does not impair EEA supervisors in respect of their individual responsibilities. The Insurance Distribution Directive ("IDD") was published in February 2016. EEA Member States were required to transpose the IDD by October 1, 2018. It replaces the existing Insurance Mediation Directive. The IDD applies to all distributors of insurance and reinsurance products (including insurers and reinsurers selling directly to customers) and strengthens the regulatory regime applicable to distribution activities through increased transparency, information and conduct requirements. The principal impact of the IDD is on the insurance market, however, requirements that apply across insurance and reinsurance include more specific conditions regarding knowledge and continuing professional development requirements for those involved in distribution of (re)insurance products. The IDD continues the existing ability for intermediaries established in a Member State of the EU to establish branches and provide services to all EEA states. Arch Underwriters Europe, being established in Ireland and ARCH CAPITAL 22 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents authorized by the CBOI, is able, subject to regulatory notifications and there being no objection from the CBOI, to establish branches and provide services in all EEA states. Privacy . The European General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR aims to introduce consistent data protection rules across the EU and EEA, and its scope extends to certain entities not established in the EEA if they process personal data or offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EEA data subjects. The GDPR contains a number of requirements regarding the processing of personal data about individuals, including mandatory security breach reporting, new and strengthened individual rights, evidenced data controller accountability for compliance with the GDPR principles (including fairness and transparency), maintenance of data processing activity records and the implementation of privacy by design, including through the completion of mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessments in connection with higher risk data processing activities. Switzerland In December 2008, Arch Re Europe opened Arch Re Europe Swiss Branch as a branch office. As Arch Re Europe is domiciled outside of Switzerland and its activities are limited to reinsurance, the Arch Re Europe Swiss Branch in Switzerland is not required to be licensed by the Swiss insurance regulatory authorities. In August 2014, Arch Underwriters Europe opened a branch office in Zurich (Arch Underwriters Europe Swiss Branch) to render reinsurance advisory services to certain group companies. Arch Underwriters Europe Swiss Branch is registered with the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich. Since its activities are limited to advisory services for reinsurance matters, the Arch Underwriters Europe Swiss Branch is not required to be licensed by the Swiss insurance regulatory authorities. Australia APRA is an independent statutory authority that supervises institutions across banking, insurance and superannuation and promotes financial stability in Australia. Arch LMI was authorized by APRA in January 2019 to conduct monoline lenders mortgage insurance business in Australia. Major regulatory requirements that are applicable to Arch LMI as an insurance provider in Australia include requirements on minimum capital levels and compliance with corporate governance standards, including the risk management strategy for our Australian mortgage insurance business. Hong Kong The Hong Kong insurance industry is regulated by the Insurance Authority, the regulatory authority established pursuant to the Insurance Ordinance (Cap. 41), whose principal function is to regulate and supervise the insurance industry for the promotion of the general stability of the insurance industry and for the protection of existing and potential policyholders. Arch MI Asia is authorized to carry on general business Class 14 (Credit) and Class 16 (Miscellaneous Financial Loss), in or from Hong Kong. Major regulatory requirements that are applicable to Arch MI Asia as a general business insurer include requirements on minimum paid-up capital, minimum solvency margin and maintenance of assets in Hong Kong. TAX MATTERS The following summary of the taxation of Arch Capital and the taxation of our shareholders is based upon current law and is for general information only. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. The following legal discussion (including and subject to the matters and qualifications set forth in such summary) of certain tax considerations (a) under Taxation of Arch CapitalBermuda and Taxation of ShareholdersBermuda is based upon the advice of Conyers Dill & Pearman Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda and (b) under Taxation of Arch Capital-United States, Taxation of Shareholders-United States Taxation, Taxation of Our U.S. Shareholders and United States Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders is based upon the advice of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, New York, New York (the advice of such firms does not include accounting matters, determinations or conclusions relating to the business or activities of Arch Capital). The summary is based upon current law and is for general information only. The tax treatment of a holder of our common or preferred shares, or of a person treated as a holder of our shares for U.S. federal income, state, local or non-U.S. tax purposes, may vary depending on the holders particular tax situation. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations may be forthcoming that could be retroactive and could affect the tax consequences to us or to holders of our shares. Taxation of Arch Capital Bermuda . Under current Bermuda law, Arch Capital is not subject to tax on income or profits, withholding, capital gains or capital transfers. Arch Capital has obtained from the Minister of Finance under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to Arch Capital or to any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other obligations until March 31, 2035. We could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after ARCH CAPITAL 23 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents that date. This assurance will be subject to the proviso that it is not to be construed so as to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (we are not so currently affected) or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to us or our insurance subsidiary. We pay annual Bermuda government fees, and our Bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiary pays annual insurance license fees. In addition, all entities employing individuals in Bermuda are required to pay a payroll tax and other sundry taxes payable, directly or indirectly, to the Bermuda government. United States . Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to conduct their operations in a manner that will not cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and, therefore, will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes (other than U.S. excise taxes on insurance and reinsurance premium and withholding taxes on dividends and certain other U.S. source investment income). However, because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. is not provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), or regulations or court decisions, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not contend successfully that Arch Capital or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are or have been engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. A foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as the branch profits tax, on its income, which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provisions of a tax treaty. Such income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a domestic corporation, except that deductions and credits generally are not permitted unless the foreign corporation has timely filed a U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with applicable regulations. Penalties may be assessed for failure to file tax returns. The 30% branch profits tax is imposed on net income after subtracting the regular corporate tax and making certain other adjustments. Under the income tax treaty between Bermuda and the U.S. (the Treaty), Arch Capital's Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. income tax on any insurance premium income found to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business only if that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the U.S. No regulations interpreting the Treaty have been issued. While there can be no assurances, Arch Capital does not believe that any of its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries has a permanent establishment in the U.S. Such subsidiaries would not be entitled to the benefits of the Treaty if (i) 50% or less of Arch Capital's shares were beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Bermuda residents or U.S. citizens or residents, or (ii) any such subsidiary's income were used in substantial part to make disproportionate distributions to, or to meet certain liabilities to, persons who are not Bermuda residents or U.S. citizens or residents. While there can be no assurances, Arch Capital believes that its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are eligible for Treaty benefits. The Treaty clearly applies to premium income, but may be construed as not protecting investment income. If Arch Capitals Bermuda insurance subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business and were entitled to the benefits of the Treaty in general, but the Treaty were not found to protect investment income, a portion of such subsidiaries investment income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Non-U.S. insurance companies carrying on an insurance business within the U.S. have a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income, determined in accordance with a formula that depends, in part, on the amount of U.S. risk insured or reinsured by such companies. If any of Arch Capital's non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the U.S., a significant portion of such company's investment income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Non-U.S. corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. are nonetheless subject to U.S. income tax on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits and income derived from sources within the U.S. as enumerated in Section 881(a) of the Code (such as dividends and certain interest on investments), subject to exemption under the Code or reduction by applicable treaties. The U.S. also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to non-U.S. insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the U.S. The rates of tax, unless reduced by an applicable U.S. tax treaty, are 4% for non-life insurance premiums and 1% for life insurance and all reinsurance premiums. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Cuts Act) was signed into law by the President of the United States in 2017. For taxable years beginning after 2017, the Tax Cuts Act imposes a 10% minimum base erosion and anti-abuse tax (increased to 12.5% for the 2026 taxable year and the subsequent taxable years) on the modified taxable income of a U.S. corporation (or a non-U.S. corporation engaged in a U.S. trade or business) over such corporations regular U.S. federal income tax, reduced by certain tax credits. The modified taxable income of a corporation is determined without deduction for certain payments by such corporation to its non-U.S. affiliates (including reinsurance premiums). Final regulations interpreting the base erosion and anti-abuse tax were issued in December 2019. United Kingdom . Our U.K. subsidiaries are companies incorporated and have their central management and control in the U.K., and are therefore resident in the U.K. for corporation ARCH CAPITAL 24 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents tax purposes. As a result, they will be subject to U.K. corporation tax on their respective profits. The U.K. branches of Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) will be subject to U.K. corporation tax on the profits (both income profits and chargeable gains) attributable to each branch. The rate of U.K. corporation tax for the financial year is 19% on profits. Canada . Arch Insurance Canada, a Canadian federal insurance company, commenced underwriting in 2013. Arch Re U.S., through a branch, commenced underwriting reinsurance in Canada in January 2015. Arch Insurance Canada is taxed on its worldwide income. Arch Re U.S. is taxed on its net business income earned in Canada. The general federal corporate income tax rate in Canada is currently 15%. Provincial and territorial corporate income tax rates are added to the general federal corporate income tax rate and generally vary between 10% and 16%. Ireland . Each of Arch Re Europe, Arch Insurance (EU) and Arch Underwriters Europe is incorporated and resident in Ireland for corporation tax purposes and will be subject to Irish corporate tax on its worldwide profits, including the profits of the branches of Arch Re Europe and Arch Underwriters Europe. Any creditable foreign tax payable will be creditable against Arch Re Europes Irish corporate tax liability on the results of Arch Re Europes branches with the same principle applied to Arch Underwriters Europes branches. The current rate of Irish corporation tax applicable to such trading profits is 12.5%. Switzerland . Arch Re Europe Swiss Branch and Arch Underwriters Europe Swiss Branch are subject to Swiss corporation tax on the profit which is allocated to the branch. The effective tax rate is approximately 21.15% for Swiss federal, cantonal and communal corporation taxes on the profit. The effective tax rate of the annual cantonal and communal capital taxes on the equity which is allocated to Arch Re Europe Swiss Branch and Arch Underwriters Europe Swiss Branch is approximately 0.17%. Denmark . Arch Re Denmark, established as a subsidiary of Arch Re Bermuda, is subject to Danish corporation taxes on its profits at a rate of 22% for 2016 and onwards. Hong Kong. Arch MI Asia is subject to Hong Kong corporate tax on its assessable profits at a rate of 16.5%. Assessable profits are the net profits for the basis period, arising in or derived from Hong Kong. Australia . Arch LMI, an Australian incorporated and tax resident company, is subject to Australian corporate tax on its worldwide profits. The current rate of Australian corporation tax applicable to such profits is 30%. Taxation of Shareholders Bermuda . Currently, there is no Bermuda withholding tax on dividends paid by us. United StatesGeneral . The following summary sets forth certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common shares and our non-cumulative preferred shares (preferred shares). Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals only with shareholders (U.S. holders) that are U.S. Persons (as defined below) who hold their common shares and preferred shares as capital assets and as beneficial owners. The following discussion is only a general summary of the U.S. federal income tax matters described herein and does not purport to address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular shareholder in light of such shareholders specific circumstances. In addition, the following summary does not describe the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to certain types of shareholders, such as banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, financial asset securitization investment trusts, dealers in securities or traders that adopt a mark-to-market method of tax accounting, tax exempt entities, expatriates, U.S. holders that hold our common shares or preferred shares through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary, persons who hold the common shares or preferred shares as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or as part of a straddle, who may be subject to special rules or treatment under the Code or persons required for U.S. federal income tax purposed to recognize income no later than such income is reported on such persons applicable financial statements. This discussion is based upon the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated there under and any relevant administrative rulings or pronouncements or judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and as currently interpreted, and does not take into account possible changes in such tax laws or interpretations thereof, which may apply retroactively. This discussion does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments within the U.S., or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to our common shares or preferred shares or the shareholders. Persons considering making an investment in the common shares or preferred shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction prior to making such investment. If an entity that is treated as a partnership holds our common shares or preferred shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our common shares or preferred shares, you should consult your tax advisor. ARCH CAPITAL 25 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S. Person means:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.;  a corporation or entity treated as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source;  a trust if either (i) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or  any other person or entity that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing. United StatesTaxation of Dividends. The preferred shares should be properly classified as equity rather than debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the discussions below relating to the potential application of the controlled foreign corporation (CFC), related person insurance income (RPII) and passive foreign investment companies (PFIC) rules, as defined below, cash distributions, if any, made with respect to our common shares or preferred shares will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as computed using U.S. tax principles). If a U.S. holder of our common shares or our preferred shares is an individual or other non-corporate holder, dividends paid, if any, to that holder that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at the rate applicable for long-term capital gains (generally up to 20%), provided that such person meets a holding period requirement. Generally in order to meet the holding period requirement, the U.S. Person must hold the common shares for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and must hold preferred shares for more than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date. Dividends paid, if any, with respect to common shares or preferred shares generally will be qualified dividend income, provided the common shares or preferred shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. in the year in which the shareholder receives the dividend (which should be the case for shares that are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange) and Arch Capital is not considered to be a passive foreign investment company in either the year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. No assurance can be given that the preferred shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. See Taxation of Our U.S. Shareholders below. A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. holders net investment income for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holders modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individual will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individuals circumstances). A U.S. holders net investment income will generally include its dividend income and its net gains from the disposition of our common shares and preferred shares, unless such dividend income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). Distributions with respect to the common shares and the preferred shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to U.S. corporations under the Code. To the extent distributions on our common shares and preferred shares exceed our earnings and profits, they will be treated first as a return of the U.S. holder's basis in our common shares and our preferred shares to the extent thereof, and then as gain from the sale of a capital asset. United StatesSale, Exchange or Other Disposition. Subject to the discussions below relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules, holders of common shares and preferred shares generally will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or preferred shares, as applicable. United StatesRedemption of Preferred Shares. A redemption of the preferred shares will be treated under section 302 of the Code as a dividend if we have sufficient earnings and profits, unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in section 302(b) of the Code enabling the redemption to be treated as a sale or exchange, subject to the discussion herein relating to the potential application of the CFC, RPII and PFIC rules. Under the relevant Code section 302(b) tests, the redemption should be treated as a sale or exchange only if it (1) is substantially disproportionate, (2) constitutes a complete termination of the holder's stock interest in us or (3) is not essentially equivalent to a dividend. In determining whether any of these tests are met, shares considered to be owned by the holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares actually owned, must generally be taken into account. It may be more difficult for a U.S. Person who owns, actually or constructively by operation of the attribution rules, any of our other shares to satisfy any of the above requirements. The determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section 302(b) of the Code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the preference shares depends on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made. Taxation of Our U.S. Shareholders Controlled Foreign Corporation Rules . We or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be treated as a CFC with respect to any ARCH CAPITAL 26 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents taxable year if at any time during such taxable year, one or more 10% Shareholders (as defined below) collectively own more than 50% of us or such non-U.S. subsidiary (as applicable) by vote or value (taking into account shares actually owned by such U.S. holder as well as shares attributed to such U.S. holder under the Code or the regulations thereunder). For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, a 10% Shareholder means any shareholder who was considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a 10% Shareholder also includes any shareholder who is considered to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the value of our shares or those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). As a result, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the voting cut-back limitation contained in our bye-laws that limits the votes conferred by the Controlled Shares (as defined in our bye-laws) of any U.S. Person to 9.9% of the total voting power of all our shares entitled to vote will not prevent any U.S. holder from being treated as a 10% Shareholder. Due to the repeal of section 958(b)(4) under the Tax Cuts Act, all non-U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by Arch Capital are treated as constructively owned by its US subsidiaries, and therefore are treated as CFCs. Status as a CFC would not cause us or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Such status also would have no adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for any U.S. holder that is not a 10% Shareholder with respect to us or any of such non-U.S. subsidiaries (as applicable). If we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are or were a CFC with respect to any taxable year, a U.S. holder that is considered a 10% U.S. Shareholder would be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation (at ordinary income tax rates) to the extent of all or a portion of the undistributed earnings and profits of Arch Capital and our subsidiaries attributable to subpart F income (including certain insurance premium income and investment income) or global intangible low-taxed income and may be taxable at ordinary income tax rates on any gain recognized on a sale or other disposition (including by way of repurchase or liquidation) of our common shares or preferred shares to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits attributable to such common shares or preferred shares. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a helpful limitation, which provides that a U.S. shareholder would not be subject to the current inclusion rules of Subpart F for a taxable year unless the non-U.S. corporation was a CFC for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during such taxable year, will no longer apply. Related Person Insurance Income Rules . Generally, we do not expect the gross RPII of any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to equal or exceed 20% of its gross insurance income in any taxable year for the foreseeable future (the RPII 20% gross income exception). Consequently, we do not expect any U.S. person owning common shares or preferred shares to be required to include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes RPII income, but there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Section 953(c)(7) of the Code generally provides that Section 1248 of the Code (which generally would require a U.S. holder to treat certain gains attributable to the sale, exchange or disposition of common shares or preferred shares as a dividend) will apply to the sale or exchange by a U.S. shareholder of shares in a foreign corporation that is characterized as a CFC under the RPII rules if the foreign corporation would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation, regardless of whether the U.S. shareholder is a 10% U.S. Shareholder or whether the corporation qualifies for the RPII 20% gross income exception. Although existing U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury) regulations do not address the question, proposed Treasury regulations issued in April 1991 create some ambiguity as to whether Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 would apply when the foreign corporation has a foreign insurance subsidiary that is a CFC for RPII purposes and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation. We believe that Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 will not apply to a less than 10% U.S. Shareholder because Arch Capital is not directly engaged in the insurance business. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the Treasury will not take the position that Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 will apply to dispositions of our common shares or our preferred shares. If the IRS or Treasury were to make Section 1248 and the Form 5471 filing requirement applicable to the sale of our shares, we would notify shareholders that Section 1248 of the Code and the requirement to file Form 5471 will apply to dispositions of our shares. Thereafter, we would send a notice after the end of each calendar year to all persons who were shareholders during the year notifying them that Section 1248 and the requirement to file Form 5471 apply to dispositions of our shares by U.S. holders. We would attach to this notice a copy of Form 5471 completed with all our information and instructions for completing the shareholder information. Tax-Exempt Shareholders . Tax-exempt entities may be required to treat certain Subpart F insurance income, including RPII, that is includible in income by the tax-exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income. Prospective investors that are tax exempt entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the potential impact of the unrelated business taxable income provisions of the Code. Passive Foreign Investment Companies . Sections 1291 through 1298 of the Code contain special rules applicable with respect to foreign corporations that are PFICs. In general, a foreign corporation will be a PFIC if 75% or more of its income constitutes passive income or 50% or more of its assets ARCH CAPITAL 27 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents produce passive income. If we were to be characterized as a PFIC, U.S. holders would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of their sale of (or receipt of an excess distribution with respect to) their common shares or preferred shares. In general, a shareholder receives an excess distribution if the amount of the distribution is more than 125% of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years (or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the stock). In general, the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares, computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain (in the case of a sale) with respect to the shares was taxable in equal portions throughout the holders period of ownership. The interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of U.S. federal income tax for such period. A U.S. shareholder may avoid some of the adverse tax consequences of owning shares in a PFIC by making a qualified electing fund (QEF) election. A QEF election is revocable only with the consent of the IRS and has the following consequences to a shareholder:  For any year in which Arch Capital is not a PFIC, no income tax consequences would result.  For any year in which Arch Capital is a PFIC, the shareholder would include in its taxable income a proportionate share of the net ordinary income and net capital gains of Arch Capital and certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, the determination of whether the active insurance company exception applies to an insurance company was made on a case-by-case basis and the analysis was inherently subjective. Under the Tax Cuts Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the active insurance company exception applies only if (i) the company would be taxed as an insurance company were it a U.S. corporation and (ii) either (A) loss and loss adjustment expense and certain reserves constitute more than 25% of the companys gross assets for the relevant year or (B) loss and loss adjustment expenses and certain reserves constitute more than 10% of the companys gross assets for the relevant year and, based on the applicable facts and circumstances, the company is predominantly engaged in an insurance business and the failure of the company to satisfy the preceding 25% test is due solely to run-off related or other specified circumstances involving the insurance business. The PFIC statutory provisions contain a look-through rule that states that, for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets of any other corporation in which it owns at least 25% of the stock. We believe that we were not a PFIC for any taxable year beginning on or before December 31, 2017 and we are not expecting to become a PFIC for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and we will use reasonable best efforts to cause us and each of our majority owned non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries not to constitute a PFIC. In July 2019, the IRS issued proposed regulations in an attempt to define the foreign insurance company exception to the PFIC rules (the proposed PFIC insurance regulations). No regulations interpreting the substantive PFIC provisions have yet been finalized. It is possible that the regulations interpreting the PFIC provisions will be issued in the future and contain rules different from those in the proposed PFIC insurance regulations. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor as to the effects of these rules. United States Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders Taxation of Dividends . Cash distributions, if any, made with respect to common shares or preferred shares held by shareholders who are not U.S. Persons (Non-U.S. holders) generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition . Non-U.S. holders of common shares or preferred shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of such shares unless such gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. holder in the U.S. or such person is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year the gain is realized and certain other requirements are satisfied. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding . Non-U.S. holders of common shares or preferred shares will not be subject to U.S. information reporting or backup withholding with respect to dispositions of common shares effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker, unless the broker has certain connections to the U.S. or is a U.S. person. No U.S. backup withholding will apply to payments of dividends, if any, on our common shares or our preferred shares. FATCA Withholding . Sections 1471 through 1474 to the Code, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), impose a withholding tax of 30% on U.S.-source interest, dividends and certain other types of income, which is received by a foreign financial institution (FFI), unless such FFI enters into an agreement with the IRS to obtain certain information as to the identity of the direct and indirect owners of accounts in such institution. In addition, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on the above payments to certain non-financial foreign entities which do not (i) certify to each respective withholding agent that they have no substantial U.S. owners ( i.e. , a U.S. 10% direct or indirect shareholder), or (ii) provide such withholding agent with the certain information as to the identity of such substantial U.S. owners. The U.S. has entered into intergovernmental agreements to implement FATCA (IGAs) with a number of jurisdictions. Bermuda has signed an IGA with the U.S. Different rules than those described above may apply under such an IGA. ARCH CAPITAL 28 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Although dividends with respect to our common shares or preferred shares will generally be treated as foreign source for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes, it is unclear whether, for FATCA purposes, some or all of our dividends may be recharacterized as U.S. source dividends. Treasury regulations addressing this topic have not yet been issued. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the filing and information requirements that may be imposed on them in respect of their ownership of our common share or preferred shares. Other Tax Laws . Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the applicability to them of the tax laws of other jur

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

RISK FACTORS Set forth below are risk factors relating to our business. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. You should carefully consider these risks along with the other information provided in this report, including our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as the information under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC. Risks Relating to Our Industry We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry. The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, many of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. See Competition in Item 1 for details on our competitors in each of the major segments we operate in. There has been significant consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance sector in recent years and we may experience increased competition as a result of that consolidation, with consolidated entities having enhanced market power. These consolidated entities may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to negotiate price reductions for products and services that compete with ours, and we may experience rate declines and possibly write less business. Any failure by us to effectively compete could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly cyclical, and we expect to continue to experience periods characterized by excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates. Historically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions, changes in equity, debt and other investment markets, changes in legislation, case law and prevailing concepts of liability and other factors. In particular, demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by the underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return being realized in the insurance and reinsurance industry on both underwriting and investment sides. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels and changes in terms and conditions. The supply of insurance and reinsurance has increased over the past several years and may increase further, either as a result of capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers. Continued increases in the supply of insurance and reinsurance may have consequences for us, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, and less favorable policy terms and conditions. ARCH CAPITAL 29 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Claims for catastrophic events could cause large losses and substantial volatility in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We have large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made catastrophic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, droughts and other natural disasters. The frequency and severity of natural catastrophe activity, including hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods and droughts, has also been greater in recent years. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as workers compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of the property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time. Actual losses from future catastrophic events may vary materially from estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors, including the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients, brokers and ceding companies, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, the contingent nature of business interruption exposures, the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity and attendant coverage issues. In addition, over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Although the loss experience of catastrophe insurers and reinsurers has historically been characterized as low frequency, there is a growing consensus today that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and, in recent years, the frequency of major catastrophes appears to have increased, and may continue to increase in the future. Claims for catastrophic events, or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period, could expose us to large losses, cause substantial volatility in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to write new business if we are not able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors. Additionally, catastrophic events could result in increased credit exposure to reinsurers and other counterparties we transact business with, declines in the value of investments we hold and significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations. Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business. We attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance. Underwriting controls can include more restrictive underwriting criteria such as higher premiums and deductibles, or losses retained, and more specifically excluded policy risks. Our deductible in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions and surplus preservation. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more catastrophic events. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events and the continuation and worsening of recent trends could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability have become major topics that encompass a wide range of issues, such as climate change and other environmental risks. It is something that has come to the fore at a European level. For example, the European Commission has published non-binding guidelines on non-financial reporting (to include climate-change related information). It may well be that mandatory, rather than voluntary, disclosure requirements will be introduced in due course which could have an impact on the operation model of Arch Capital. We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism, cyber-attacks, pandemics and political instability, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have substantial exposure to unexpected, large losses resulting from future man-made catastrophic events, such as acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. These risks are inherently unpredictable. It is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. In certain instances, we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from acts of terrorism. We may also insure against risk related to cybersecurity and cyber-attacks. In addition, our exposure to cyber-attacks includes exposure to silent cyber risks, meaning risks and potential losses associated with policies where cyber risk is not specifically included nor excluded in the policies. Even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism, cybersecurity and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us, we may not be successful in doing so. Moreover, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will not limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us. Accordingly, while we believe our reinsurance programs, together with the coverage provided under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of ARCH CAPITAL 30 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents 2002, as amended are sufficient to reasonably limit our net losses relating to potential future terrorist attacks, we can offer no assurance that our available capital will be adequate to cover losses when they materialize. To the extent that an act of terrorism is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury and aggregate industry insured losses resulting from the act of terrorism exceeds the prescribed program trigger, our U.S. insurance operations may be covered under TRIP for up to 80% subject to a mandatory deductible of 20% of our prior years direct earned premium for covered property and liability coverages. The program trigger for calendar year 2020 is $200 million. If an act (or acts) of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit, insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses. It is not possible to completely eliminate our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events, and to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our operations are also exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. For example, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak which emanated from China was a global health emergency. This has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses not just in China but in other parts of Asia as well. With a recent rise in the number of cases of the coronovirus outside of China, travel restrictions and other disruption to businesses globally have also increased. While the effects of the coronavirus will be difficult to assess or predict, an outbreak could have a significant impact on our business. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output, as well as on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses we experience. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. Political, regulatory, legislative and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business. Governmental authorities in the U.S. and worldwide have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial systems in general and there may be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future. For example, in the U.S., the federal government (including federal consumer protection authorities) has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years, and various state legislators are considering or have enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies. The U.S. mortgage insurance industry has also been subject to increased federal and state regulatory scrutiny (including by state insurance regulatory authorities), which could generate new regulations, regulatory actions or investigations. In the EU, Solvency II imposed economic risk-based solvency requirements across all EU Member States covering quantitative capital requirements, qualitative regulatory reviews and market discipline. In addition, Solvency II imposes significant requirements for our EU-based regulated companies which require substantial documentation and implementation effort. Following the U.K.s departure from the EU, it is uncertain whether the U.K. will maintain equivalence with Solvency II beyond the end of the Transition Period. The BMA has also implemented and imposed additional requirements on the commercial insurance companies it regulates, driven, in large part, by Solvency II. The European Commission has adopted a decision concluding that Bermuda meets the full equivalence criteria under Solvency II. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing or scope of any possible governmental initiatives, such proposals could adversely affect our business by, among other things: providing reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target; requiring our further participation in industry pools and guaranty associations; expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies ( e.g. , following large disasters); further regulating the terms of insurance or reinsurance contracts; or disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another. In addition, increased scrutiny by insurance regulators of investments in or acquisitions of insurers or insurance holding companies by private equity firms or hedge funds may result in imposition of additional regulatory requirements and restrictions. We have in the past partnered with private equity firms in making investments and may do so in the future. This increased scrutiny may make it difficult to complete investments with private equity or hedge funds should we seek to do so. Underwriting risks and reserving for losses are based on probabilities and related modeling, which are subject to inherent uncertainties. Our success is dependent upon our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our ARCH CAPITAL 31 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves. Most or all of these factors are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and the effects of these and unforeseen factors could negatively impact our ability to accurately assess the risks of the policies that we write. Changes in the assumptions used by these models or by management could lead to an increase in our estimate of ultimate losses in the future. In addition, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlement of claims. Unfavorable development in any of these factors could cause the level of reserves to be inadequate. In addition, the estimation of loss reserves is also more difficult during times of adverse economic and market conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims. Changes in the level of inflation also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of loss reserves. As a result, actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate, we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency becomes known. It is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our claim reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, in a particular period, or our financial condition in general. As a compounding factor, although most insurance contracts have policy limits, the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies, thereby further adversely affecting our financial condition. In accordance with mortgage insurance industry practice, we establish loss reserves only for loans in our existing delinquency inventory. Because our mortgage insurance reserving process does not take account of the impact of future losses from loans that are not delinquent, mortgage insurance loss reserves are not intended to be an estimate of total future losses. Our expectation of total future losses under our mortgage insurance policies in force at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements. In addition to establishing loss reserves for delinquent loans, under GAAP, we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount of expected future losses for a particular product and maintenance costs for such product exceeds expected future premiums, existing reserves and the anticipated investment income. We evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists quarterly. There can be no assurance that premium deficiency reserves will not be required in future periods. If this were to occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2019 , our consolidated reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, were approximately $9.81 billion . Such reserves were established in accordance with applicable insurance laws and GAAP. Loss reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. In establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, we have made various assumptions relating to the pricing of our reinsurance contracts and insurance policies and have also considered available historical industry experience and current industry conditions. Any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors, including the fact that relatively limited historical information has been reported to us through December 31, 2019 . The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written. In the case of proportional treaties, we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events. In our insurance operations, we seek to limit our exposure through the purchase of reinsurance. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, in addition to utilizing reinsurance, we have developed a proprietary risk model that simulates the maximum loss resulting from a severe economic event impacting the housing market. We cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective. We also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. Geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zones limits. Various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risk, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise. Underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not ARCH CAPITAL 32 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents provide sufficient guidance. No assurances can be made that these loss limitation methods will be effective and mitigate our loss exposure. One or more catastrophic events or severe economic events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, or the protections set forth in our policies could be voided, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity. In addition, factors such as global climate change limit the value of historical experience and therefore further limit the effectiveness of our loss limitation methods. See Catastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events in Item 7 for further details. Depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance portfolio, we may seek to adjust our self-imposed limitations on probable maximum pre-tax loss for catastrophe exposed business and mortgage default exposed business. Adverse developments in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital; our policyholders, reinsurers and retrocessionaires may also be affected by such developments, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Adverse developments in the financial markets, such as disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, may result in realized and unrealized capital losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Depending on market conditions, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses on our investment portfolio in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. Economic conditions could also have a material impact on the frequency and severity of claims and therefore could negatively impact our underwriting returns. In addition, our policyholders, reinsurers and retrocessionaires may be affected by developments in the financial markets, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. The volatility in the financial markets could continue to significantly affect our investment returns, reported results and shareholders equity. The U.K.s Withdrawal from the EU could adversely affect us. In a referendum in June 2016, a majority of voting U.K. citizens voted in favor of Brexit, whereby the U.K. will leave the EU. The U.K. government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (Article 50) in 2017. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU. Terms of this withdrawal are set forth in the Withdrawal Agreement, which was approved by the U.K. Parliament and the EU Parliament. The Withdrawal Agreement allows for a Transition Period whereby "passporting" rights will continue to exist until the end of the Transition Period, which is December 31, 2020 (unless a single extension of one to two years to this Transition Period is agreed between the U.K. government and the EU, by June 30, 2020, although the U.K. government has indicated that no extension will be sought). During the Transition Period, the U.K. government and the EU will endeavor to negotiate a trade deal to govern the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. If a trade deal is not agreed by the end of the Transition Period (and no extension to the Transition Period is agreed between the U.K. and the EU), the U.K. will leave the EU on December 31, 2020 on World Trade Organization ("WTO") terms, meaning that most U.K. goods will be subject to tariffs until a free trade deal is brought in and "passporting" rights will cease to apply. Accordingly, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU during the Transition Period and the ultimate structure of the U.Ks future relationship with the EU. There is no certainty that the U.K.s solvency and prudential regime will be deemed equivalent to Solvency II or that the U.K. will not impose more stringent requirements on companies conducting insurance business in the U.K. During this Transition Period and beyond, the impact of the U.K.s withdrawal on the U.K. and European economies and the broader global economy could be significant, resulting in negative consequences, such as increased volatility and illiquidity, and potentially lower economic growth in various markets in the U.K., Europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU. We anticipate that Brexit may disrupt our U.K. domiciled entities, including our Lloyds syndicates, and their ability to passport within the EU. Similarly, Brexit may disrupt the ability of our EU domiciled entities to access the U.K. markets although the U.K is attempting to mitigate this by introducing a temporary permissions regime which allows firms that wish to continue carrying out regulated activities in the U.K. in the longer term to operate in the U.K for a limited period after withdrawal, while they seek authorization from the U.K. regulators. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the U.K. and EU enter into regarding their future relationship. The negative impact of these events on economic conditions and global markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. For example, this crisis may cause the value of the European currencies, including the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, to further depreciate against the U.S. Dollar, which in turn could materially adversely impact assets denominated in such currencies held in our investment portfolio or results of our European book of business. In ARCH CAPITAL 33 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents addition, the applicable legal framework and the terms of our Euro-denominated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements generally do not address withdrawal by a member state from the Eurozone or a break-up of the EU, which could create uncertainty in our payment obligations and rights under those policies and agreements in the event that such a withdrawal or break-up does occur. Additionally, a contagion effect of a possible default of one or more EU Member States and/or their withdrawal from the Eurozone, or the failure of financial institutions, on the global economy, including other EU Member States and our counterparties located in those countries, or a break-up of the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the EU. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain. The risk associated with underwriting treaty reinsurance business could adversely affect us. Like other reinsurers, our reinsurance group does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties. Therefore, we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. We are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. The availability of reinsurance, retrocessional coverage and capital market transactions to limit our exposure to risks may be limited, and counterparty credit and other risks associated with our reinsurance arrangements may result in losses which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For the purposes of managing risk, we use reinsurance, retrocessional coverage and capital markets transactions. In the normal course of business, our insurance subsidiaries cede a portion of their premiums through pro rata, excess of loss and facultative reinsurance agreements. Our reinsurance subsidiaries purchase a limited amount of retrocessional coverage as part of their aggregate risk management program. In addition, our reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties, including the reinsurers, such as our reinsurance subsidiaries, and the ceding company. Economic conditions could also have a material impact on our ability to manage our risk aggregations through reinsurance or capital markets transactions. The availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions, which are beyond our control. As a result of such market conditions and other factors, we may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements. Further, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and retrocessions because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with carriers we view as substantial and financially sound. Although we have not experienced any material credit losses to date, an inability of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our losses for a given event or occurrence may increase if our reinsurers or retrocessionaires dispute or fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance or retrocessional protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable for any reason. Our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk. In accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such payment, we may remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency. Likewise, in certain jurisdictions, when the insured or ceding company pays the premiums for these contracts to brokers for payment to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding company will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our brokers. To date, we have not experienced any losses related to this credit risk. Emerging claim and coverage issues may adversely affect our business. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or otherwise require us to make unplanned modifications to the products and services that we provide, or cause the delay or cancellation of products ARCH CAPITAL 34 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents and services that we provide. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. The effects of unforeseen developments or substantial government intervention could adversely impact our ability to achieve our goals. Changes in current accounting principles and practices and financial reporting requirements may materially affect our reported financial results and our reported financial condition. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and they are subject to the accounting-related rules and interpretations of the SEC. We are required to adopt new and revised accounting standards implemented by the FASB. Unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in accounting principles, practices and standards, particularly those that apply to insurance companies, cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net earnings, shareholders' equity and other relevant financial statement line items. In addition, such changes may cause additional volatility in reported earnings, decrease the understandability of our financial results and affect the comparability of our reported results with the results of others. Risks Relating to Our Company Acquisitions, the addition of new lines of insurance or reinsurance business, expansion into new geographic regions and/or entering into joint ventures or partnerships expose us to risks. We may seek, from time to time, to acquire other companies, acquire selected blocks of business, expand our business lines, expand into new geographic regions and/or enter into joint ventures or partnerships. Such activities expose us to challenges and risks, including: integrating financial and operational reporting systems; establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls; funding increased capital needs, overhead expenses or cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated sales and revenues are not realized or are delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties; obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations; obtaining necessary regulatory permissions; and establishing adequate reserves for any acquired book of business. In addition, the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates; the liabilities assumed may be greater than expected; and assets and liabilities acquired may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We may also be subject to financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities or business we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification, reinsurance and other contractual obligations to us. Our failure to manage successfully any of the foregoing challenges and risks may adversely impact our results of operations. The ultimate performance of the Arch MI U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio remains uncertain. Arch MI U.S. had risk in force of approximately $73.4 billion , before external reinsurance, as of December 31, 2019 , including $3.9 billion of risk in force originated in 2009 and prior. The presence of multiple higher-risk characteristics in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a claim on such a loan unless there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk. The mix of business in our insured loan portfolio may affect losses and remain uncertain. The frequency and severity of claims we incur will be uncertain and will depend largely on general economic factors outside of our control, including, among others, changes in unemployment, home prices and interest rates in the U.S. Deteriorating economic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect the performance of our acquired U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Generally, we cannot cancel mortgage insurance coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a mortgage insurance policy. As a result, higher than anticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by our non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. In addition, the premium rate for loans that refinanced in 2019 may be lower than premium rates charges on the original purchase in prior years. The premiums charged on the acquired UGC insured loan portfolio, and the associated investment income, may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to customers. A downgrade in our ratings or our inability to obtain a rating for our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may adversely affect our relationships with clients and brokers and negatively impact sales of our products. A ratings downgrade or the potential for such a downgrade, or failure to obtain a necessary rating, could adversely affect our relationships with agents, brokers, wholesalers, intermediaries, clients and other distributors of our existing products and services, as well as new sales of our products and services. In addition, under certain of the reinsurance agreements assumed by our reinsurance operations, upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade or other specified triggering event with respect to ARCH CAPITAL 35 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents our reinsurance operations, such as a reduction in surplus by specified amounts during specified periods, our ceding company clients may be provided with certain rights, including, among other things, the right to terminate the subject reinsurance agreement and/or to require that our reinsurance operations post additional collateral. Any ratings downgrade or failure to obtain a necessary rating could adversely affect our ability to compete in our markets, could cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a downgrade in ratings of certain of our operating subsidiaries would in certain cases constitute an event of default under our credit facilities. For further information on our financial strength and/or issuer ratings, see Ratings in Item 1. For further information on our letter of credit facilities, see the Letter of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities section of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments in Item 7. We can offer no assurances that our ratings will remain at their current levels or that any of our ratings which are under review or watch by ratings agencies will remain unchanged. We believe it is possible that rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny they apply when analyzing companies in our industry, may increase the frequency and scope of their reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate (including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held), and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels. Our success will depend on our ability to maintain and enhance effective operating procedures and internal controls and our enterprise risk management (ERM) program. Operational risk and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures, failure to appropriately transition new hires or external events. We continue to enhance our operating procedures and internal controls (including information technology initiatives and controls over financial reporting) to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that our goals are met. Any ineffectiveness in our controls or procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business. We operate within an ERM framework designed to assess and monitor our risks. However, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will operate within the ERM framework. There can be no assurance that our ERM framework will result in us accurately identifying all risks and accurately limiting our exposures based on our assessments. For further information on our ERM framework, see Enterprise Risk Management in Item 1. Our business is dependent upon insurance and reinsurance brokers and intermediaries, and the loss of important broker relationships could materially adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. We market our insurance and reinsurance products primarily through brokers and intermediaries. We derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of brokers. During 2019 , approximately 12.2% and 9.6% of our gross premiums written were generated from or placed by Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries and Marsh & McLennan Companies and its subsidiaries, respectively. No other broker and no one insured or reinsured accounted for more than 10% of gross premiums written for 2019 . Some of our competitors have higher financial strength ratings, offer a larger variety of products, set lower prices for insurance coverage, offer higher commissions and/or have had longer term relationships with the brokers we use than we have. This may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain brokers to sell our insurance products or brokers may increasingly promote products offered by other companies. The failure or inability of brokers to market our insurance products successfully, or loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ARCH CAPITAL 36 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents We could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents, general agents and other producers exceed their underwriting authorities or if our agents, our insureds or other third parties commit fraud or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. For certain business conducted by our insurance group, following our underwriting, financial, claims and information technology due diligence reviews, we authorize managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us. In addition, our mortgage group delegates the underwriting of a significant percentage of its primary new insurance written to certain mortgage lenders. Under this delegated underwriting program, the approved customer may determine whether mortgage loans meet our mortgage insurance program guidelines and commit us to issue mortgage insurance. We rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us. Although we have contractual protections in some instances and we monitor such business on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. In addition, our agents, our insureds or other third parties may commit fraud or otherwise breach their obligations to us. To the extent that our agents, our insureds or other third parties exceed their underwriting authorities, commit fraud or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business operations . In addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance recoverables and reliance on brokers and other agents (each discussed elsewhere in this section), we are exposed to credit risk in other areas of our business related to policyholders. We are exposed to credit risk in our insurance groups surety unit where we guarantee to a third party that our policyholder will satisfy certain performance or financial obligations. If our policyholder defaults, we may suffer losses and be unable to be reimbursed by our policyholder. We are exposed to credit risk in our insurance groups construction and national accounts units where we write large deductible insurance policies. Under these policies, we are typically obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim (shown as contractholder payables on our consolidated balance sheets). We are subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount (shown as contractholder receivables on our consolidated balance sheets), which can be a set amount per claim and/or an aggregate amount for all covered claims. As such, we are exposed to credit risk from the policyholder. We are also exposed to credit risk from policyholders on smaller deductibles in other insurance group lines, such as healthcare and excess and surplus casualty. Additionally, we write retrospectively rated policies ( i.e. , policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). In this instance, we are exposed to credit risk to the extent the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium. While we generally seek to mitigate this risk through collateral agreements that require the posting of collateral in such forms as cash and letters of credit from banks, our efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our policyholders may not be successful. Although we have not experienced any material credit losses to date, an increased inability of our policyholders to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business. Our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. A significant portion of cash and invested assets held by Arch consists of fixed maturities ( 75.8 % as of December 31, 2019 ). Although our current investment guidelines and approach stress preservation of capital, market liquidity and diversification of risk, our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations. In addition, we are subject to risks inherent in particular securities or types of securities, as well as sector concentrations. Changing market conditions could materially affect the future valuation of securities in our investment portfolio, which could cause us to impair some portion of those securities. We may not be able to realize our investment objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In the event that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our expected insurance and reinsurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and ability to conduct our business. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our financial results. We write business on a worldwide basis, and our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the value of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The primary foreign currencies in which we operate are the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can reduce our revenues, increase our liabilities and costs and cause fluctuations in the valuation of our investment portfolio. We may therefore suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. In order to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we may replicate investment positions in foreign currencies using derivative financial instruments. Changes in ARCH CAPITAL 37 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents the value of investments due to foreign currency rate movements are reflected as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders' equity and are not included in the statement of income. We have chosen not to hedge certain currency risks on capital contributed to certain subsidiaries, and may continue to choose not to hedge our currency risks. There can be no assurances that arrangements to match projected liabilities in foreign currencies with investments in the same currencies or derivative financial instruments will mitigate the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations, and we may suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. We may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including interest rate changes. Our operating results are affected by, and we are exposed to, significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, real estate values, foreign currency exchange rates, market volatility, the performance of the economy in general, the performance of our investment portfolio and other factors outside our control. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. and other major economies, inflation, economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in changing interest rate environments, we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. Despite our mitigation efforts, an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value. Our investment portfolio includes residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). As of December 31, 2019 , RMBS constituted approximately 2.4% of cash and invested assets held by Arch. As with other fixed income investments, the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and interest rate trends. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and RMBS are prepaid more quickly, requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates. Conversely, in periods of rising rates, mortgage prepayments generally fall, preventing us from taking full advantage of the higher level of rates. The residential mortgage market in the U.S has experienced a variety of difficulties in certain underwriting periods. A decline or an extended flattening in residential property values may result in additional increases in delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans generally, especially with respect to any residential mortgage loans where the aggregate loan amounts (including any subordinate loans) are close to or greater than the related property values. These developments may have a significant adverse effect on the prices of loans and securities, including those in our investment portfolio and may have other wide ranging consequences, including downward pressure on economic growth and the potential for increased insurance and reinsurance exposures, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations. Mortgage insurance losses result when a borrower becomes unable to continue to make mortgage payments and the home of such borrower cannot be sold for an amount that covers unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale. Deteriorating economic conditions increase the likelihood that borrowers will have insufficient income to pay their mortgages and can adversely affect housing values. In addition, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could result in increased claims if such events adversely affected the employment and income of borrowers and the value of homes. Any of these events or deteriorating economic conditions could cause our mortgage insurance losses to increase and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Catastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events in Item 7 for further details. Our portfolio includes commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS). At December 31, 2019 , CMBS constituted approximately 3.3% of cash and invested assets held by Arch. The commercial real estate market may experience price deterioration, which could lead to delinquencies and losses on commercial real estate mortgages. In addition, in each year, a significant portion of our mortgage insurance premiums will be from mortgage insurance written in prior years. The length of time insurance remains in force, referred to as persistency, is a significant driver of mortgage insurance revenues. Factors affecting persistency include: current mortgage interest rates compared to those rates on mortgages in our insurance in force, which affects the likelihood of the insurance in force to be subject to cancellation due to borrower refinancing; the amount of home equity, as homeowners with more equity in their homes can generally more readily move to a new residence or refinance their existing mortgage; and mortgage insurance cancellation policies and practices of mortgage investors and mortgage services and the cancellation of borrower-paid mortgage insurance, either upon request of the borrower or as required by law based upon the amortization of the loan. In 2018, the GSEs announced changes to various mortgage insurance termination requirements that are intended to further simplify the process of evaluating borrower-initiated requests for mortgage insurance termination. Among other things, these changes update evidence of value requirements for borrower requested cancellation based on the original value of the property and the current value of the property, raise Fannie Maes loan-to-value ratio for cancellation based on substantial improvements from 75% or less to 80% or less, provide clarification regarding what constitutes substantial improvements to the property, allow servicers to respond to either verbal or written requests for mortgage insurance cancellation by a borrower, and provide servicers flexibility in evaluating the payment history of borrowers that have been impacted by certain disaster events. ARCH CAPITAL 38 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Fannie Mae implemented these changes by March 1, 2019, although certain requirements were implemented as early as January 1, 2019. Freddie Macs requirements became effective October 1, 2018. If these or other factors cause the length of time our mortgage insurance policies remain in force to decline, our mortgage insurance revenues could be adversely affected. Significant, continued volatility in financial markets, changes in interest rates, a lack of pricing transparency, decreased market liquidity, declines in equity prices and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments and changes in unrealized positions. Uncertainty relating to the determination of LIBOR and the potential phasing out and replacement of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our cost of capital, net investment income and mortgage reinsurance costs. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, LIBOR and certain other indices which are currently utilized as benchmarks are not expected to be published after 2021. LIBOR is the benchmark rate that is used by many banks and issuers to set interests in loan documents. Recognizing the need to replace LIBOR, authorities in the United States convened the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) in 2014 to identify a replacement for LIBOR. In 2017, the ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) - a combination of certain overnight repo rates, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR, and in April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the SOFR rate. Because SOFR is an overnight rate, versus the various term rates that are available with LIBOR, and SOFR is also a risk-free rate, versus LIBOR which has an embedded credit charge, the transition from LIBOR to SOFR will require adjustments. The uncertainty of these adjustments, and the timing of when the transition will occur may adversely affect the value of and trading market for LIBOR-based securities. Moreover, the transition to SOFR from LIBOR for U.S. Dollar transactions as well as LIBOR transitions in other currencies and any future reform, replacement or disappearance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return of our investment portfolio, our cost of capital and our cost of issuing Bellemeade mortgage risk transfer securities. We do not believe that it is possible to predict how markets will respond to the transition to SOFR from LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments or quantify the potential effect of any such event on us at this time. While we have an internal committee focused on managing the replacement of LIBOR for our investments and operations, we do not believe that it is possible to predict how markets will respond to the transition to SOFR, or any other rate, from LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments or quantify the potential effect of any such event on us at this time. The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. On a quarterly basis, we perform reviews of our investments to determine whether declines in fair value below the cost basis are considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable accounting guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. The process of determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires judgment and involves analyzing many factors. These factors include: an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer; the time period in which there was a significant decline in value; the significance of the decline; and the analysis of specific credit events. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. Further, rapidly changing and unpredictable credit and equity market conditions could materially affect the valuation of securities carried at fair value as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our investments are illiquid and are difficult to sell, or to sell in significant amounts at acceptable prices, to generate cash to meet our needs. Our investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income and structured securities, investments in funds accounted for using the equity method, other alternative investments and strategic investments in joint ventures such as Watford, Premia and others, may be illiquid due to contractual provisions or investment market conditions. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, then we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or may be forced to sell or terminate them at unfavorable values. We may require additional capital or credit in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. The capital requirements of our businesses depend on many factors, including regulatory and rating agency requirements, the performance of our investment portfolio, our ability to write new business successfully, the frequency and severity of catastrophe events and our ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. We may need ARCH CAPITAL 39 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. Equity financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders and could result in the issuance of securities that have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities. If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See Capital Resources in Item 7 for further details. The loss of our key employees or our inability to retain them could negatively impact our business. Our success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The pool of talent from which we actively recruit is limited. Although, to date, we have not experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining key personnel, the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our underwriting staff is critical to our success in the production of business. While we do not consider any of our key executive officers or underwriters to be irreplaceable, the loss of the services of our key executive officers or underwriters or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy which could affect our financial performance. Our information technology systems may be unable to meet the demands of customers. Our information technology systems service our insurance portfolios. Accordingly, we are highly dependent on the effective operation of these systems. While we believe that the systems are adequate to service our insurance portfolios, there can be no assurance that they will operate in all manners in which we intend or possess all of the functionality required by customers currently or in the future. Our customers, especially our mortgage insurance customers, require that we conduct our business in a secure manner, electronically via the Internet or via electronic data transmission. We must continually invest significant resources in establishing and maintaining electronic connectivity with customers. In order to integrate electronically with customers in the mortgage insurance industry, we require electronic connections between our systems and those of the industry's largest mortgage servicing systems and leading loan origination systems. Our mortgage group currently possesses connectivity with certain of these external systems, but there is no assurance that such connectivity is sufficient and we are continually undertaking new electronic integration efforts with third-party loan servicing and origination systems. We also rely on electronic integrations in our insurance operations, both in the U.S. and the U.K. The extent to which our insurance operations utilize electronic connections with external systems will expand to address the increasing importance of the use of the information technology for our insurance customers. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if we do not possess or timely acquire the requisite set of electronic integrations necessary to keep pace with the technological demands of customers. Technology breaches or failures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from a malicious cyber attack on us or our business partners and service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business and/or expose us to litigation. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our employees and our business partners and service providers depends on information technology and electronic information exchange. Like all companies, our information technology systems are vulnerable to data breaches, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, power outages, theft, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, errors in usage and general technology failures. Additionally, our employees and vendors may use portable computers or mobile devices which may contain duplicate or similar information to that in our computer systems, and these devices can be stolen, lost or damaged. Security breaches could expose us to the loss or misuse of our information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems could have a significant negative impact on our operations and possibly our results. A cyber incident could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, adversely affect our stock price, cause us to incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs and/or increased insurance premiums, and/or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our business. We have outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue do so in the future. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or the effectiveness of our control system, which could result in monetary and reputational damage or harm to competitive position. These risks could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services rather than software services which can be run within our data centers. ARCH CAPITAL 40 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents We believe that we have established and implemented appropriate security measures to provide reasonable assurance that our information technology systems are secure and appropriate controls and procedures to enable us to identify and respond to unauthorized access to such systems. We regularly engage third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of our most critical security measures, controls and procedures. Despite these security measures, controls and procedures, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible. Because we rely on our technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail or be attacked or breached, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive and process, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly changing. We are subject to EU, U.S. federal, state and other foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data and information. These laws and regulations are complex and sometimes conflict. We could be subject to fines, penalties and/or regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions if any person, including any employee, disregards or breaches, whether intentionally or negligently, controls intended to protect the confidential information of our employees or clients. Failure to timely report breach incidents under these regulations may also result in fines, penalties and/or other enforcement actions. As an example, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted a regulation pertaining to cybersecurity for all banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction that came into effect March 1, 2017. California also enacted the CCPA, which took effect January 1, 2020 and grants California consumers certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them subject to certain exceptions, as well as a private right of action with statutory penalties. Additionally, GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018, and requires businesses offering goods and services to, or monitoring the behavior of, customers in the EU to comply with onerous accountability obligations and significantly enhanced conditions to processing personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine of up to 4% of a firms global annual revenue per violation. Our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected. If the volume of low down payment mortgage originations declines, the amount of mortgage insurance we write in the U.S. could decline, which would reduce our mortgage insurance revenues. The size of the U.S. mortgage insurance market depends in large part upon the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations. Factors affecting the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include, among others: restrictions on mortgage credit due to stringent underwriting standards and liquidity issues affecting lenders; changes in mortgage interest rates and home prices, and other economic conditions in the U.S. and regional economies; population trends, including the rate of household formation; and U.S. government housing policy. A decline in the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations could decrease demand for mortgage insurance, decrease our U.S. new insurance written and reduce mortgage insurance revenues. If the role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market changes, or if the GSEs change other policies or practices, the amount of mortgage insurance that we write could decline, which would reduce our mortgage insurance revenues. The GSEs are the beneficiaries of the significant majority of the insurance policies we issue as a result of their purchases, statutorily required or otherwise, of qualifying mortgage loans from lenders or investors. The charters of the GSEs require credit enhancement for low down payment mortgages in order for such loans to be eligible for purchase or guarantee by the GSEs. If the charters of the GSEs were amended to change or eliminate the acceptability of private mortgage insurance, our mortgage insurance business could decline significantly. The FHFA has also indicated the possibility of amending the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPAs) that the GSEs have executed with the Department of Treasury or pursuing consent orders, in conjunction with releasing the GSEs from conservatorship, to place continuing restrictions on the GSEs post conservatorship. If the PSPAs include restrictions on the loans purchased by the GSEs, our mortgage insurance business could decline. The premiums we charge for mortgage insurance on insured loans and the associated investment income may not be adequate to compensate for future losses from these loans. We set premiums at the time a policy is issued based upon our expectations regarding likely performance over the life of insurance coverage. We generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a mortgage insurance policy. As a result, losses from higher than anticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. The premiums we charge on our insurance in force and the associated investment income may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to customers. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipate, could adversely affect Arch MI U.S.s results of operations and financial condition. ARCH CAPITAL 41 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents GSE eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers could require us to contribute additional capital to Arch MI U.S. in the future, and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, or reduce our operating flexibility. Substantially all of Arch MI U.S.s insurance written has been for loans sold to the GSEs. The PMIERs apply to Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, which are GSE-approved mortgage insurers (eligible mortgage insurers). The PMIERs impose limitations on the type of risk insured, the forms and insurance policies issued, standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk, procedures for claims handling, acceptable underwriting practices, standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements, among other things. The financial requirements require a mortgage insurers available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed minimum required assets as of each quarter end. Our eligible mortgage insurers each satisfied the PMIERs financial requirements as of December 31, 2019 . The revised PMIERs also impose additional operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, underwriting, quality control, and reporting. The revised requirements have caused us to make changes to our business practices and incur additional costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance with the PMIERs. While we do not expect the revised PMIERs to have a significant impact on our operations or a material impact on our capital position the increase in capital required to satisfy the revised PMIERs may decrease our return on capital. While we intend to continue to comply with these requirements, there can be no assurance that the GSEs will continue to treat Arch Mortgage Insurance Company or United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company as eligible mortgage insurers. If either or both of the GSEs were to cease to consider Arch Mortgage Insurance Company or United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company as eligible mortgage insurers and, therefore, cease accepting our mortgage insurance products, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. The mix of business we write affects Arch MI U.S.s losses and will affect the minimum required assets Arch MI U.S. is required to maintain in order to comply with PMIERs financial requirements. Our mortgage insurance portfolio includes loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 95%, loans with FICO scores below 620, adjustable rate mortgages, (ARMs), and less-than A quality loans. Even when housing values are stable or rising, we expect higher default and claim rates for high loan-to-value loans, loans with lower FICO scores, ARMs and less-than A quality loans. Although we attempt to incorporate the higher default and claim rates associated with these loans into our underwriting and pricing models, there can be no assurance that the premiums earned and the associated investment income will adequately compensate us for future losses from these loans. From time to time, we change the types of loans that we insure and the requirements under which we insure them. In 2017 and 2018, we modestly expanded our underwriting guidelines and we may further expand such guidelines in the future. The geographic mix of Arch MI U.S.s business could increase losses and harm our financial performance. We are affected by economic downturns and other events in specific regions of the United States where a large portion of our U.S. mortgage insurance business is concentrated. As of December 31, 2019 , 7.7 % of Arch MI U.S.s primary risk-in-force was located in Texas, 7.1 % was located in California and 5.3 % was located in Florida. See the Mortgage Operations Supplemental Information section of Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 7 for further details. Arch MI U.S.s minimum required assets under the PMIERs will be determined, in part, by the particular risk profiles of the loans it insures. If, absent other changes, Arch MI U.S.s mix of business changes to include more loans with higher loan-to-value ratios or lower credit scores, it will have a higher minimum required asset amount under the PMIERs and, accordingly, be required to hold more capital in order to maintain GSE eligibility. Potential changes to state mortgage insurance regulations could reduce Arch MI U.S.s profitability and its ability to compete with credit enhancement alternatives to mortgage insurance. The NAIC, which reviews state insurance laws and regulations, has established a Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group (Working Group) to make recommendations to the NAIC's Financial Condition Committee regarding changes to the NAICs Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. The Working Group has released a draft of the Model Act which includes proposed changes to minimum statutory capital requirements. If the NAIC revises the Model Act, some state legislatures are likely to enact and implement part or all of the revised provisions. While we cannot predict the effect that any NAIC recommendations or future legislation may have on Arch MI U.S., such changes could reduce Arch MI U.S.s profitability and its ability to compete with credit enhancement alternatives to mortgage insurance, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. ARCH CAPITAL 42 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents If servicers fail to adhere to appropriate servicing standards or experience disruptions to their businesses, our mortgage insurance operations could be adversely affected. We depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Among other things, our mortgage insurance policies require our customers and their servicers to timely submit premium and reports and utilize commercially reasonable efforts to limit and mitigate loss when a loan is in default. Without reliable, consistent third-party servicing, our insurance subsidiaries may be unable to correctly record new loans as they are underwritten, receive and process payments on insured loans and/or properly recognize and establish reserves on loans when a default exists or occurs but is not reported to us. In addition, if these servicers fail to limit and mitigate losses when appropriate, our losses may unexpectedly increase. If one or more servicers failed to adhere to these requirements, our financial results could be adversely affected. The implementation of the Basel III Capital Accord may adversely affect the use of mortgage insurance by certain banks. With certain exceptions, the Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2014. If further implementation of the Basel III Rules increases the capital requirements of banking organizations with respect to the residential mortgages we insure or does not provide sufficiently favorable treatment for the use of mortgage insurance, it could adversely affect the demand for mortgage insurance. In December 2017, the Basel Committee published final revisions to the Basel Capital Accord which is informally denominated in the U.S. as Basel IV. The Basel Committee expects the new rules to be phased-in beginning in January 2020 and fully implemented by January 2027. In October 2019, the EU stated that it will conduct an impact study of the new rules before implementation, indicating that additional changes are possible. Under these revised rules, banks using the standardized approach for credit risk management will determine the risk-weight for residential mortgages based on the loan-to-value ratio at loan origination, without consideration of mortgage insurance. As prescribed at the international level, the new standard would permit consideration of mortgage insurance, but only if the company issuing the insurance has a lower risk-weight than the underlying exposure. Mortgage insurance issued by private companies would not meet this test in connection with residential mortgage. Therefore, under the 2017 international agreement, mortgage insurance could not mitigate credit and lower the capital charge under the standardized approach. To date the U.S. banking agencies have not begun the implementation of Basel IV standards. If the Basel IV standard is implemented in the U.S. without modification, mortgage insurance would not lower the loan-to-value ratio of residential loans for capital purposes, and therefore the demand for this product may decrease. It is also possible that the U.S. regulatory agencies could determine that their current capital rules are at least as stringent as the Basel IV standards, in which case no change would be required regarding the treatment of mortgage insurance for capital purposes. However, if the U.S. agencies decide to implement the new standards drafted by the Basel Committee, mortgage insurance would not lower the loan-to-value ratio of residential loans for capital purposes, and therefore may decrease the demand for this product. Further, it is possible (but not mandated by the Basel Capital Accord) that the banking agencies and the GSEs might likewise discontinue taking mortgage insurance into account when determining a mortgages loan-to-value ratio for prudential (non-capital) purposes. Additionally, a new risk-based capital proposal for the GSEs was published for comment by the FHFA in 2018. Under this proposal the capital requirements of these GSEs would take into account the existence of credit mitigants, such as mortgage insurance. However, mortgage insurance issued by monoline mortgage insurance companies would result in less capital relief than the capital relief afforded by other forms of credit mitigation, such as the issuance of credit-linked notes. In November 2019 the FHFA announced that it would re-propose the 2018 capital rules in 2020. In that announcement the FHFA explained that the re-proposed rule would be consistent with the goal of releasing the GSEs from conservatorship and ensuring that taxpayers will never be on the hook again during an economic downturn. If this rulemaking is finalized, a new capital framework for the Enterprises might disadvantage monoline mortgage insurance companies, or otherwise reduce the demand for this product. The capital rules proposed by FHFA may also prompt the banking regulators to re-examine the bank capital rules, and such action could disadvantage monoline mortgage insurance companies. Some of the provisions of our bye-laws and our shareholders agreement may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers or changes in management initiated by shareholders. These provisions may also prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover. Some provisions of our bye-laws could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or changes in management initiated by shareholders. These provisions may encourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors, since the board has the authority to overrule the operation of several of the limitations. Among other things, our bye-laws provide: for a classified board of directors, in which the directors of the class elected at each annual general meeting holds office for a term of three years, with the term of each class expiring at successive annual general meetings of shareholders; that the number of directors is determined by the board from time to time by a vote of the majority of our board; that directors may only be removed for cause, and cause removal shall be deemed to exist only if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a ARCH CAPITAL 43 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents felony or been found by a court to be liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties; that our board has the right to fill vacancies, including vacancies created by an expansion of the board; and for limitations on a shareholders right to raise proposals or nominate directors at general meetings. Our bye-laws provide that certain provisions which may have anti-takeover effects may be repealed or altered only with prior board approval and upon the affirmative vote of holders of shares representing at least 65% of the total voting power of our shares entitled generally to vote at an election of directors. The bye-laws also contain a provision limiting the rights of any U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)) that owns shares of Arch Capital, directly, indirectly or constructively (within the meaning of section 958 of the Code), representing more than 9.9% of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. The votes conferred by such shares of such U.S. person will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by the shares of such person will constitute 9.9% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. Notwithstanding this provision, the board may make such final adjustments to the aggregate number of votes conferred by the shares of any U.S. person that the board considers fair and reasonable in all circumstances to ensure that such votes represent 9.9% of the aggregate voting power of the votes conferred by all shares of Arch Capital entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. Arch Capital will assume that all shareholders (other than specified persons) are U.S. persons unless we receive assurance satisfactory to us that they are not U.S. persons. The bye-laws also provide that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting power of our shares (excluding shares owned by any person (and such persons affiliates and associates) that is the owner of 15% or more (a 15% Holder) of our outstanding voting shares) shall be required for various corporate actions, including: merger or consolidation of the company into a 15% Holder; sale of any or all of our assets to a 15% Holder; the issuance of voting securities to a 15% Holder; or amendment of these provisions; provided , however , the supermajority vote will not apply to any transaction approved by the board. The provisions described above may have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. To the extent that these effects occur, shareholders could be deprived of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares and the market price of their shares could be depressed. In addition, these provisions could also result in the entrenchment of incumbent management. There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares. The jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer's holding company. Where such laws apply to us and our subsidiaries, there can be no effective change in our control unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement with the regulators and has obtained prior approval for the proposed change from such regulators. The usual measure for a presumptive change in control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable. Consequently, a person may not acquire 10% or more of our common shares without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulators. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, including transactions that some shareholders might consider to be desirable. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in various jurisdictions, and failure to comply with existing regulations or material changes in the regulation of their operations, or any investigations, inquiries or demands by government authorities, could adversely affect us. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of jurisdictions worldwide, including Bermuda, the states in the U.S. in which such subsidiaries conduct business, the U.K., certain EU Member States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Hong Kong. Existing laws and regulations, among other things, limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, prescribe solvency and capital adequacy standards, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that can be held to meet solvency and capital adequacy requirements, require the maintenance of reserve liabilities, and require pre-approval of acquisitions and certain affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to maintain appropriate authorizations, licenses, and/or exemptions under applicable laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to preclude or suspend our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries from carrying on some or all of their activities, place one or more of them into rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings, impose monetary penalties or other sanctions on them or our affiliates, or commence insurance company delinquency proceedings against our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries. The application of these laws and regulations by various governmental authorities, including authorities outside the U.S., may affect our liquidity and restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions or to pay dividends on our ordinary shares. Furthermore, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements may result in significant expenses, which could have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition to legal and regulatory requirements, the insurance and reinsurance industry has experienced substantial volatility ARCH CAPITAL 44 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents as a result of investigations, litigation and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental and enforcement authorities, including the SEC, concerning certain practices within the insurance and reinsurance industry. Our involvement in any investigations, litigations or regulatory activity, including any related lawsuits, would cause us to incur legal costs and, if we or any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries were found to have violated any laws or regulations, we could be required to pay fines and damages and incur other sanctions, perhaps in material amounts, which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Any such litigation or failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business, and could also result in suspensions, injunctions, monetary damages, fines or other sanctions, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reinsurance subsidiaries may be required to provide collateral to ceding companies, by applicable regulators, their contracts or other commercial considerations. Their ability to conduct business could be significantly and negatively affected if they are unable to do so. Arch Re Bermuda is a registered Bermuda insurance company and is not licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction in the U.S., although Arch Re Bermuda has been approved as a certified reinsurer in certain U.S. states that allow reduced collateral for reinsurance ceded to such reinsurers. Arch Re Bermuda's contracts generally require it to post a letter of credit or provide other security, even in U.S. states where it has been approved for reduced collateral. State credit for reinsurance rules also generally provide that certified reinsurers such as Arch Re Bermuda must provide 100% collateral in the event their certified status is terminated or upon the entry of an order of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation against a ceding insurer. Although, to date, Arch Re Bermuda has not experienced any difficulties in providing collateral when required, if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required, the operations of Arch Re Bermuda could be significantly and negatively affected. Arch Capital is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its operating subsidiaries. Arch Capital is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in our subsidiaries. Generally, Arch Capital depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any payments of dividends, redemption amounts or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred shares and common shares, and to fund the share repurchase program. The ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. In addition, the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Arch Capital and to intermediate parent companies owned by Arch Capital could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. We believe that Arch Capital has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations. See Capital Resources in Item 7 for further details. The service of process and enforcement of judgments against us or our directors or officers may be difficult. We are a Bermuda company and some of our officers and directors are residents of various jurisdictions outside the U.S. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those persons may be located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon those persons or to recover against us or those persons on judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws even though we have appointed National Registered Agents, Inc., New York, New York, as our agent for service of process with respect to actions based on offers and sales of securities made in the U.S. Because there is no treaty in effect between the U.S. and Bermuda providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in Bermuda, and there are grounds upon which Bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Further, no claim may be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of U.S. federal securities laws, as such laws do not have force of law in Bermuda. A Bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers in a suit brought in the Supreme Court of Bermuda if the facts alleged in the complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. Our international business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to sanctions and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate, including the U.K., Ireland and the EU. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the economic trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control as well as ARCH CAPITAL 45 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents certain laws administered by the U.S. Department of State. New sanction regimes may be initiated, or existing sanctions expanded, at any time, which can immediately impact our business activities. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act that generally bar corrupt payments or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or intermediary could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other punitive actions. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our business and/or reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risk Relating to Our Shares The market price of our common shares may experience volatility, thereby causing a potential loss of value to our investors. The market price for our common shares may fluctuate substantially and could cause investment losses. The price of our common shares may not remain at or exceed current levels. In addition to the risk factors described herein, the following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price for our common shares: announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; changes in the value of our assets; our actual or anticipated quarterly and annual operating results; changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts; issuances by us of shares or other securities; sales, or the possibility or perception of future sales, by our existing shareholders; our share repurchase program; changes in general conditions in the economy, the insurance industry or the financial markets; changes in market valuation of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry; fluctuations in stock market processes and volumes; the addition or departure of key personnel; changes in tax law; and adverse press or news announcements affecting us or the industry. General market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for our outstanding preferred shares. There can be no assurance about the market prices for our series of preferred shares that are traded publicly. Several factors, many of which are beyond our control, will influence the fair value of our preferred shares, including, but not limited to:  whether dividends have been declared and are likely to be declared on any series of our preferred shares from time to time;  our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance and prospects;  whether the ratings on any series of our preferred shares provided by any ratings agency have changed;  the market for similar securities; and  economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect us and/or the insurance or financial markets generally. Dividends on our preferred shares are non-cumulative. Dividends on our preferred shares are non-cumulative and payable only out of lawfully available funds of Arch Capital under Bermuda law. Consequently, if Arch Capital's board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period with respect to any series of our preferred shares, holders of such preferred shares would not be entitled to receive any such dividend, and such unpaid dividend will not accrue and will never be payable. Arch Capital will have no obligation to pay dividends for a dividend period on or after the dividend payment date for such period if its board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) has not declared such dividend before the related dividend payment date; if dividends on our series E or series F preferred shares are authorized and declared with respect to any subsequent dividend period, Arch Capital will be free to pay dividends on any other series of preferred shares and/or our common shares. In the past, we have not paid dividends on our common shares. Our preferred shares are equity and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness. Our preferred shares are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, these preferred shares will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation. As of December 31, 2019 , our total long-term debt was $1.73 billion , excluding the other segment. We may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict payments of dividends on our preferred shares. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred shares, (1) dividends are payable only if declared by the board of directors of Arch Capital (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and (2) as described under Risks Relating to Our CompanyArch Capital is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its operating subsidiaries, we are subject to certain regulatory and other constraints affecting our ability to pay dividends and make other payments. ARCH CAPITAL 46 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents The voting rights of holders of our preferred shares are limited. Holders of our preferred shares have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting shareholders. The limited voting rights of holders of our preferred shares include the right to vote as a class on certain fundamental matters that affect the preference or special rights of our preferred shares as set forth in the certificate of designations relating to each series of preferred shares. In addition, if dividends on our series E or series F preferred shares have not been declared or paid for the equivalent of six dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, holders of the outstanding series E or series F preferred shares will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to our board of directors subject to the terms and to the limited extent as set forth in the certificate of designations relating to such series of preferred shares. There is no limitation on our issuance of securities that rank equally with or senior to our preferred shares. We may issue additional securities that rank equally with or senior to our series E and series F preferred shares without limitation. The issuance of securities ranking equally with or senior to our preferred shares may reduce the amount available for dividends and the amount recoverable by holders of such series in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Arch Capital. Risks Relating to Taxation We and our non-U.S. subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. federal income taxation and/or the U.S. federal income tax liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries may increase, including as a result of changes in tax law. Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to operate their business in a manner that will not cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and, thus, will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes (other than U.S. excise taxes on insurance and reinsurance premium and withholding taxes on certain U.S. source investment income) on their income. However, because there is uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., there can be no assurances that the IRS will not contend successfully that Arch Capital or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. If Arch Capital or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries were subject to U.S. income tax, our shareholders' equity and earnings could be adversely affected. Congress has been considering several legislative proposals intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of Bermuda and other non-U.S. insurance companies. There is no assurance that any such legislative proposal will not be enacted into law and any such enacted law would not adversely affect income tax liabilities of us or any of our subsidiaries. The enactment and implementation of the Tax Cuts Act may have a material and adverse impact on our operations and financial condition . The Tax Cuts Act includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Certain provisions in the Tax Cuts Act could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and business operation. One such provision imposes a 10% minimum base erosion and anti-abuse tax (reduced to 5% for the 2018 taxable year and increased to 12.5% for the 2026 taxable year and the subsequent taxable years) on the modified taxable income of a U.S. corporation (or a non-U.S. corporation engaged in a U.S. trade or business) over such corporations regular U.S. federal income tax, reduced by certain tax credits. The modified taxable income of a corporation is determined without deduction for certain payments by such corporation to its non-U.S. affiliates (including reinsurance premiums). Other provisions of the Tax Cuts Act that could have a material and adverse impact on us include a provision that defers or disallows a U.S. corporations deduction of interest expense to the extent such interest expense exceeds a specified percentage of such U.S. corporations adjusted taxable income and a provision that adjusts the manner in which a U.S. property and casualty insurance company computes its loss reserve. There is no assurance that subsequent change in tax laws will not materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. The results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election could have further impacts on our industry if new legislative or regulatory reforms are adopted. We are unable to predict at this time the effect of any such reforms. Our non-U.K. companies may be subject to U.K. tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies, other than our U.K. subsidiaries and branch operations (the U.K. Group), should be resident in the U.K. for tax purposes or carry on a trade, whether or not through a permanent establishment, in the U.K. Accordingly, we do not expect that any of our other subsidiaries, other than the U.K. Group, should be subject to U.K. tax. Case law has held that whether or not a trade is being carried on in the U.K. is a matter of fact and emphasis is placed on where the operations take place from which the profits in substance arise. HM Revenue and Customs might contend successfully that one or more of ARCH CAPITAL 47 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents our subsidiaries, in addition to the U.K. Group, is carrying on a trade in the U.K. For U.K. tax purposes, a non-U.K. tax resident company will be subject to U.K. corporation tax only if it carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the U.K. However, that subsidiary may still be subject to U.K. income tax if it carries on a trade in the U.K., without a permanent establishment, unless it is entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the U.K. and the jurisdiction in which that company is resident. If any of our subsidiaries is treated as resident, or carrying on a trade, in the U.K., whether or not through a permanent establishment, and, therefore, subject to U.K. tax, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 31, 2035, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under current Bermuda law, we are not subject to tax on income, profits, withholding, capital gains or capital transfers. Furthermore, we have obtained from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of the tax will not be applicable to us or our operations until March 31, 2035. We could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after that date. This assurance does not, however, prevent the imposition of taxes on any person ordinarily resident in Bermuda or any company in respect of its ownership of real property or leasehold interests in Bermuda. The impact of Bermuda's letter of commitment to the OECD to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in Bermuda. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has published reports and launched a global initiative among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. Bermuda was not listed in the most recent report as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices, to embrace international tax standards for transparency, to exchange information and to eliminate an environment that attracts business with no substantial domestic activity. We are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes. The impact of commitments made by the government of Bermuda in order to avoid being named on the EUs list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions is uncertain and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Following a year-long screening process, on December 5, 2017 the Council of the European Union published its list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the EU Blacklist). Bermuda was not named on the EU Blacklist due to commitments made by its government to improve certain substance requirement deficiencies that were identified by the EU during the screening process. This commitment led to the passing of the ES Act in December 2018. See Economic Substance Act under the heading Regulation for further details. As noted above, the ES Act requires in-scope Bermuda entities to demonstrate that they have adequate economic substance in Bermuda. Broadly, this is expected to be the case where an entity can demonstrate it has adequate income generating activities, employees, premises, and expenditure incurred in Bermuda, although the meaning of adequate in this context remains unclear. Further, the speed with which the ES Act was implemented, and the uncertainties in its interpretation, make it difficult to predict its future impact. Any entity found to be lacking adequate economic substance may be fined or ordered by a court to take action to remedy such failure (or face being struck off the companies register). As a result, there is a risk that non-compliance with its economic substance requirements under the ES Act could require Arch to enhance its infrastructure in Bermuda, and this may result in some additional operational expenditures, increased tax liabilities and/or compliance costs for Arch. We may become subject to increased taxation in Bermuda and other countries as a result of the OECD's plan on Base erosion and profit shifting. The OECD, with the support of the G20, initiated the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project in 2013 in response to concerns that international tax standards have not kept pace with changes in global business practices and that changes are needed to international tax laws to address situations where multinationals may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdictions by shifting profits away from jurisdictions where the activities creating those profits may take place. In October 2015, the OECD issued final reports in connection with the BEPS project. The final reports were approved for adoption by the G20 finance ministers in November 2015. The final reports provide the basis for international standards for corporate taxation that are designed to prevent, among other things, the artificial shifting of income to tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions, the erosion of the tax base through interest deductions on intercompany debt and the artificial avoidance of permanent establishments (i.e., tax nexus with a jurisdiction). Legislation to adopt these standards has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions to ARCH CAPITAL 48 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents implement these standards, including country by country reporting. As a result, our income may be taxed in jurisdictions where it is not currently taxed and at higher rates of tax than currently taxed, which may substantially increase our effective tax rate. Also, the continued adoption of these standards may increase the complexity and costs associated with tax compliance and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In May 2019, the OECD published a Programme of Work, divided into two pillars, which is designed to address the tax challenges created by an increasing digitalized economy. Pillar One addresses the broader challenge of a digitalized economy and focuses on the allocation of group profits among taxing jurisdictions based on a market-based concept rather than historical permanent establishment concepts. Pillar Two addresses the remaining BEPS risk of profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions by introducing a global minimum tax and a proposed tax on base eroding payments, which would operate through a denial of a deduction or imposition of source-based taxation (including withholding tax) on certain payments. In January 2020, the OECD released a statement excluding most financial services activities, including insurance activities, from the scope of the profit reallocation mechanism in Pillar I. The OECD statement cited the presence of commercial (rather than consumer) customers as grounds for the carve-out, but also acknowledged that a compelling case could be made that the consumer-facing business lines of insurance companies should be excluded from the scope of Pillar I given the impact of regulations and licensing requirements that typically ensure that residual profits are largely realized in local customer markets. However, the OECD noted that the proper scope for Pillar I as applied to unregulated elements of the financial services sector may require further consideration. The OECD expects to reach agreement on key policy issues by July 2020, with a final proposal to be agreed to by the participating members by the end of 2020 and incorporated into local jurisdiction tax laws and treaties sometime shortly thereafter. To date, the proposal has been written broadly enough to potentially apply to our activities, and we are unable to determine at this time when such measures would be implemented and if so, whether they will be in a form that whether it would have a material adverse impact on our operations and results. The EUs review of harmful tax competition could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. During 2017, the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) released a list of noncooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The stated aim of this list, and accompanying report, was to promote good governance worldwide in order to maximize efforts to prevent tax fraud and tax evasion. Bermuda was not on the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, but did feature in the report (along with approximately 40 other jurisdictions) as having committed to address concerns relating to economic substance by December 31, 2018. In accordance with that commitment, Bermuda has enacted legislation that requires certain entities in Bermuda engaged in relevant activities to maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda and to satisfy economic substance requirements. The list of relevant activities includes carrying on as a business any one or more of: banking, insurance, fund management, financing, leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service center, intellectual property and holding entities. Any entity that must satisfy economic substance requirements but fails to do so could face automatic disclosure to competent authorities in the EU of the information filed by the entity with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies in connection with the economic substance requirements and may also face financial penalties, restriction or regulation of its business activities and/or may be struck off as a registered entity in Bermuda. At present, the impact of these new economic substance requirements is unclear, and it is impossible to predict the nature and effect of these requirements on us. The new economic substance requirements may increase the complexity and costs of carrying on our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Application of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives As part of the BEPS project, the EU Council adopted on 12 July 2016 Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 ("ATAD I"), as amended by Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 ("ATAD II", together with ATAD I, "ATAD"), to provide for minimum standard across EU Member States for tackling aggressive tax planning involving hybrid tax mismatches and interest deductibility. ATAD I was required to be transposed into domestic Member State law with effect from January 1, 2019, whilst ATAD II was required to be transposed into domestic Member State law with effect from January 1, 2020 (with an exception in respect of reverse hybrid mismatch provisions, which should take effect from January 1, 2021). The full impact of the application of ATAD is not yet clear. However, ATAD could adversely affect our financial position and operations, including through the increase of our: (i) our tax burden; (ii) expenditure to ensure compliance; and (iii) administrative burden. ARCH CAPITAL 49 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We lease office space in Bermuda where our principal offices are located.

Our mortgage group leases space for offices in the U.S., Hong Kong and Australia. We believe that the above described office space is adequate for our needs. However, as we continue to develop our business, we may open additional office locations in 2020. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation and arbitration in the normal course of our business.

. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , including comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Comparisons between 2018 and 2017 have been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current assessment of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements and, therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them. Important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements are discussed in this report, including the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Risk Factors. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under Item 8. Tabular amounts are in U.S. Dollars in thousands, except share amounts, unless otherwise noted. GENERAL Overview Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Arch Capital and, together with its subsidiaries, we or us) is a Bermuda public limited liability company with approximately $13.23 billion in capital at December 31, 2019 and, through operations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong, writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, as well as mortgage insurance and reinsurance, on a worldwide basis. It is our belief that our underwriting platform, our experienced management team and our strong capital base have enabled us to establish a strong presence in the insurance and reinsurance markets. The worldwide property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive and has traditionally been subject to an underwriting cycle in which a hard market (high premium rates, restrictive underwriting standards, as well as terms and conditions, and underwriting gains) is eventually followed by a soft market (low premium rates, relaxed underwriting standards, as well as broader terms and conditions, and underwriting losses). Property casualty market conditions may affect, among other things, the demand for our products, our ability to increase premium rates, the terms and conditions of the insurance policies we write, changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy. The financial results of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and/or severity of claims and losses, including natural disasters or other catastrophic events, variations in interest rates and financial markets, changes in the legal, regulatory and judicial environments, inflationary pressures and general economic conditions. These factors influence, among other things, the demand for insurance or reinsurance, the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market. Mortgage insurance and reinsurance is subject to similar cycles to property casualty except that they have historically been more dependent on macroeconomic conditions. Current Outlook Our objective is to achieve an average operating return on average equity of 15% or greater over the insurance cycle, which we believe to be an attractive return to our common shareholders given the risks we assume. We continue to look for opportunities to find acceptable books of business to underwrite without sacrificing underwriting discipline and continue to write a portion of our overall book in catastrophe-exposed business which has the potential to increase the volatility of our operating results. In 2019, property and casualty rates increased in many lines of business and we believe that insurance markets remain in a transitioning phase. Given the uncertainty of current claim trends, the industry needs further rate increases to provide insurers an adequate buffer and a positive risk-reward proposition. In this kind of environment, risk selection and active capital allocation remain critical to generating superior returns. Strengthening market conditions are evident to us from both the rise in our submission activity and our ability to achieve significant rate increases across numerous lines of business. Reinsurance pricing tends to follow that of the primary insurance industry although catastrophe and large attritional losses, such as the Japanese typhoons this year, can disproportionately affect results and create opportunities in the reinsurance market. We believe that property facultative and marine businesses are examples of improving markets. Our underwriting teams continue to execute a disciplined strategy by emphasizing small and medium-sized accounts over large accounts, shrinking premiums in more commoditized ARCH CAPITAL 55 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents lines such as general liability and by utilizing reinsurance purchases to reduce volatility on large account, high capacity business. The spread between rate changes and loss trend continues to be a key variable in assessing expected returns and can be difficult to quantify precisely, particularly in specialty lines. Our mortgage segment continues to experience generally favorable market conditions. Although pricing remains competitive in the U.S., borrower credit quality and the general economy remain strong. Our results continue to reflect our success in making high quality credit underwriting risk decisions and building customer relationships. Arch remains committed to providing solutions across many offerings as the marketplace evolves, including new mortgage credit risk transfer programs initiated by government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, in 2018. Such programs have begun generating business with banks developing new systems to handle the programs and momentum beginning to build. In addition, we completed multiple Bellemeade risk transfers to the capital markets throughout 2019, increasing our protection for mortgage tail risk. FINANCIAL MEASURES Management uses the following three key financial indicators in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for Arch Capitals common shareholders: Book Value per Share Book value per share represents total common shareholders equity available to Arch divided by the number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Management uses growth in book value per share as a key measure of the value generated for our common shareholders each period and believes that book value per share is the key driver of Arch Capitals share price over time. Book value per share is impacted by, among other factors, our underwriting results, investment returns and share repurchase activity, which has an accretive or dilutive impact on book value per share depending on the purchase price. Book value per share was $26.42 at December 31, 2019 , a 22.8% increase from $21.52 at December 31, 2018 . The growth in 2019 reflected strong mortgage insurance underwriting performance and investment returns. Operating Return on Average Common Equity Operating return on average common equity (Operating ROAE) represents annualized after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity available to Arch during the period. After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure as defined in the SEC rules, represents net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and transaction costs and other, net of income taxes. Management uses Operating ROAE as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders. See Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Our Operating ROAE was 12.0% for 2019 , compared to 10.7% for 2018 . The higher Operating ROAE for 2019 reflected favorable mortgage insurance market conditions, strong investment returns and a lower level of catastrophic activity. Total Return on Investments Total return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Archs investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses excluding amounts reflected in the other segment, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders on the capital held in the business, and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns which we measured our portfolio against during the periods. The following table summarizes the pre-tax total return (before investment expenses) of investment held by Arch compared to the benchmark return (both based in U.S. Dollars) against which we measured our portfolio during the periods: Arch Portfolio (1) Benchmark Return Pre-tax total return (before investment expenses): Year Ended December 31, 2019 7.30 % 7.39 % Year Ended December 31, 2018 0.33 % -0.60 % (1) Our investment expenses were approximately 0.33% and 0.36% , respectively, of average invested assets in 2019 and 2018 . Total return for our investment portfolio was in line with the benchmark return index in 2019 and reflected strong total returns on our investment grade fixed income and equity portfolios. The benchmark return index is a customized combination of indices intended to approximate a target portfolio by asset mix and average credit quality while also matching the approximate estimated duration and currency mix of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Although the estimated duration and ARCH CAPITAL 56 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents average credit quality of this index will move as the duration and rating of its constituent securities change, generally we do not adjust the composition of the benchmark return index except to incorporate changes to the mix of liability currencies and durations noted above. The benchmark return index should not be interpreted as expressing a preference for or aversion to any particular sector or sector weight. The index is intended solely to provide, unlike many master indices that change based on the size of their constituent indices, a relatively stable basket of investable indices. At December 31, 2019 , the benchmark return index had an average credit quality of  Aa3  by Moodys, an estimated duration of 3.02 years. The benchmark return index included weightings to the following indices: % ICE BoAML 1-10 Year AAA - A U.S. Corporate Index 21.00 % ICE BoAML 1-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index 15.00 ICE BoAML 3-5 Year Fixed Rate Asset Backed Securities Index 7.00 ICE BoAML 1-10 Year U.S. Municipal Securities Index 5.00 Bloomberg Barclays CMBS Invest Grade Aaa Total Return Index 5.00 MSCI ACWI Net Total Return USD Index 5.00 Hedge Fund Research HFRX Fixed Income Credit Index 5.00 Hedge Fund Research HFRX Equal Weighted Strategies 5.00 ICE BoAML 1-10 Year BBB U.S. Corporate Index 4.00 ICE BoAML German Government 1-10 Year Index 4.00 ICE BoAML U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index 4.00 ICE BoAML 0-3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index 4.00 ICE BoAML 1-5 Year U.K. Gilt Index 3.50 ICE BoAML 5-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index 3.00 ICE BoAML 1-5 Year Australian Governments Index 3.00 ICE BoAML U.S. High Yield Constrained Index 2.50 S&P Leveraged Loan Total Return Index 2.50 ICE BoAML 1-5 Year Canada Government Index 1.00 ICE BoAML 20 Year Canada Government Index 0.50 Total 100.00 % COMMENT ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this filing, we present our operations in the way we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information in evaluating the performance of our company. This presentation includes the use of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, loss on redemption of preferred shares and income taxes, and the use of annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included under Results of Operations below. We believe that net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other and loss on redemption of preferred shares in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business. Although net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of our operations, the decision to realize investment gains or losses, the recognition of the change in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the fair value option in net realized gains or losses, the recognition of net impairment losses, the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method and the recognition of foreign exchange gains or losses are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Furthermore, certain users of our financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, net impairment losses recognized in earnings on our investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. The use of the equity method on certain of our investments in certain funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way we account for our other fixed maturity securities and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. Transaction costs and other include advisory, financing, legal, severance, incentive compensation and other transaction costs related to acquisitions. We believe that transaction costs and other, due to their non-recurring nature, are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business performance. The loss on redemption of preferred ARCH CAPITAL 57 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents shares related to the redemption of our Series C preferred shares in January 2018 and had no impact on shareholders' equity or cash flows. Due to these reasons, we exclude net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other and loss on redemption of preferred shares from the calculation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders. We believe that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business since we evaluate the performance of and manage our business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income available to Arch common shareholders, we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. We also believe that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of financial information to compare our performance with our industry peer group. We believe that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow us and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. Our segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss and a subtotal of underwriting income or loss before the contribution from the other segment. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not incorporate items included in our corporate (non-underwriting) segment. While these measures are presented in note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis and a subtotal before the contribution from the other segment, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown in note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We measure segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income and other non-underwriting related items are not allocated to each underwriting segment. For the other segment, performance is measured based on net income or loss. Along with consolidated underwriting income, we provide a subtotal of underwriting income or loss before the contribution from the other segment. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, Watford is considered a variable interest entity and we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of Watford. As such, we consolidate the results of Watford in our consolidated financial statements, although we only own approximately 13% of Watfords common equity as of December 31, 2019. Watford has its own management and board of directors that is responsible for its results and profitability. In addition, we do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford. Since Watford is an independent company, the assets of Watford can be used only to settle obligations of Watford and Watford is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments. Our financial exposure to Watford is limited to our investment in Watfords senior notes, common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. We believe that presenting certain information excluding the other segment enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how our management analyzes performance. Our presentation of segment information includes the use of a current year loss ratio which excludes favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves. This ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measure to the loss ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G is shown on the individual segment pages. Management utilizes the current year loss ratio in its analysis of the underwriting performance of each of our underwriting segments. Total return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Archs investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses, excludes amounts reflected in the other segment, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for total return. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders on the capital held in the business, and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns which we measured our portfolio against during the periods. ARCH CAPITAL 58 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes our consolidated financial data, including a reconciliation of net income available to Arch common shareholders to after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders. Each line item reflects the impact of our percentage ownership of Watfords common equity during such period. Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Net income available to Arch common shareholders $ 1,594,707 $ 713,616 Net realized (gains) losses (353,013 ) 297,755 Net impairment losses recognized in earnings 3,165 2,829 Equity in net (income) loss of investments accounted for using the equity method (123,672 ) (45,641 ) Net foreign exchange (gains) losses 10,732 (59,890 ) Transaction costs and other 14,444 12,377 Loss on redemption of preferred shares  2,710 Income tax expense (benefit) (1) 16,276 (14,566 ) After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders $ 1,162,639 $ 909,190 Beginning common shareholders equity $ 8,659,827 $ 8,324,047 Ending common shareholders equity 10,717,371 8,659,827 Average common shareholders equity $ 9,688,599 $ 8,491,937 Annualized return on average common equity % 16.5 8.4 Annualized operating return on average common equity % 12.0 10.7 (1) Income tax on net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other and loss on redemption of preferred shares reflects the relative mix reported by jurisdiction and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. Results in all periods presented reflected the impact of current insurance and reinsurance market conditions and the impact of low interest yields on our investment portfolio. Segment Information We classify our businesses into three underwriting segments  insurance, reinsurance and mortgage  and two other operating segments  corporate (non-underwriting) and other. Our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision makers, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Arch Capital and the Chief Financial Officer of Arch Capital. The chief operating decision makers do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment. We determined our reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results. Insurance Segment The following tables set forth our insurance segments underwriting results: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 % Change Gross premiums written $ 3,907,993 $ 3,262,332 19.8 Premiums ceded (1,266,267 ) (1,050,207 ) Net premiums written 2,641,726 2,212,125 19.4 Change in unearned premiums (244,646 ) (6,464 ) Net premiums earned 2,397,080 2,205,661 8.7 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (1,615,475 ) (1,520,680 ) Acquisition expenses (361,614 ) (349,702 ) Other operating expenses (454,770 ) (364,138 ) Underwriting income (loss) $ (34,779 ) $ (28,859 ) n/m Underwriting Ratios % Point Change Loss ratio 67.4 % 68.9 % (1.5 ) Acquisition expense ratio 15.1 % 15.9 % (0.8 ) Other operating expense ratio 19.0 % 16.5 % 2.5 Combined ratio 101.5 % 101.3 % 0.2 The insurance segment consists of our insurance underwriting units which offer specialty product lines on a worldwide basis, as described in note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. ARCH CAPITAL 59 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Premiums Written . The following tables set forth our insurance segments net premiums written by major line of business: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Professional Lines $ 534,323 20.2 $ 450,406 20.4 Programs 426,535 16.1 393,263 17.8 Property, energy, marine and aviation 368,120 13.9 219,174 9.9 Construction and national accounts 369,202 14.0 320,937 14.5 Travel, accident and health 305,170 11.6 290,401 13.1 Excess and surplus casualty 228,023 8.6 168,467 7.6 Lenders products 111,708 4.2 96,094 4.3 Other 298,645 11.3 273,383 12.4 Total $ 2,641,726 100.0 $ 2,212,125 100.0 Net premiums written by the insurance segment were 19.4 % higher in 2019 than in 2018 . Approximately thirty percent of the growth in net premiums written resulted from our new businesses acquired during 2019 or new business initiatives or product lines. The remaining growth came from expansion in existing products and accounts, and rate increases across most lines of business. Net Premiums Earned . The following tables set forth our insurance segments net premiums earned by major line of business: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Professional Lines $ 499,224 20.8 $ 458,425 20.8 Programs 414,103 17.3 389,186 17.6 Property, energy, marine and aviation 298,966 12.5 205,069 9.3 Construction and national accounts 325,687 13.6 322,440 14.6 Travel, accident and health 305,085 12.7 297,147 13.5 Excess and surplus casualty 200,615 8.4 172,424 7.8 Lenders products 66,079 2.8 94,248 4.3 Other 287,321 12.0 266,722 12.1 Total $ 2,397,080 100.0 $ 2,205,661 100.0 Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . The table below shows the components of the insurance segments loss ratio: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Current year 68.1 % 70.0 % Prior period reserve development (0.7 )% (1.1 )% Loss ratio 67.4 % 68.9 % Current Year Loss Ratio . The insurance segments current year loss ratio was 1.9 points lower in 2019 than in 2018 . The 2019 loss ratio included 1.4 points of current year catastrophic event activity, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, compared to 3.4 points in 2018 , primarily related to Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the California wildfires. The balance of the change in the 2019 loss ratio resulted, in part, from changes in mix of business and the level of large attritional losses. Prior Period Reserve Development . The insurance segments net favorable development was $15.8 million , or 0.7 points, for 2019 , compared to $24.4 million , or 1.1 points, for 2018 .

The growth in gross premiums written primarily reflected new business opportunities in casualty and property lines, partially offset by a decline in other specialty business, driven by reductions in motor and agriculture business. The growth in net premiums written is less than the growth in gross premiums written because a high proportion of the property business is subject to retrocessions. Net premiums written in 2018 included a higher level of reinstatement premiums, due to 2018 catastrophic events, as well as premium adjustments on a multi-year casualty contract. Net Premiums Earned . The following tables set forth our reinsurance segments net premiums earned by major line of business: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Other specialty $ 478,517 32.6 $ 474,568 37.6 Casualty 429,288 29.3 347,034 27.5 Property excluding property catastrophe 362,841 24.7 287,788 22.8 Property catastrophe 90,934 6.2 75,249 6.0 Marine and aviation 48,274 3.3 39,238 3.1 Other 56,535 3.9 37,339 3.0 Total $ 1,466,389 100.0 $ 1,261,216 100.0 Net premiums earned in 2019 were 16.3 % higher than in 2018 , reflecting changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters, including the mix and type of business written. Other Underwriting Income (Loss). Other underwriting income in 2019 was $6.4 million , compared to other underwriting loss of $0.7 million in 2018 . Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . The table below shows the components of the reinsurance segments loss ratio: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Current year 72.2 % 78.1 % Prior period reserve development (3.2 )% (11.0 )% Loss ratio 69.0 % 67.1 % Current Year Loss Ratio . The reinsurance segments current year loss ratio was 5.9 points lower in 2019 than in 2018 . The 2019 loss ratio included 5.7 points for current year catastrophic event activity, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai, compared to 10.1 points in 2018 , primarily related to Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and the California wildfires.The 2018 loss ratio includes the impact of a large attritional casualty loss arising from the California wildfires that increased the 2018 loss ratio by 1.7 points. The balance of the change in the 2019 current year loss ratio resulted, in part, from the effects of market conditions and changes in the mix of business. ARCH CAPITAL 61 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Prior Period Reserve Development . The reinsurance segments net favorable development was $46.4 million , or 3.2 points, for 2019 , compared to $138.5 million , or 11.0 points, for 2018 , See note 5, Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about the reinsurance segments prior year reserve development. Underwriting Expenses . The underwriting expense ratio for the reinsurance segment was 25.9% in 2019 , compared to 27.4% in 2018 , reflecting growth in net premiums earned and changes in mix of business. Mortgage Segment Our mortgage operations include U.S. and international mortgage insurance and reinsurance operations as well as participation in GSE credit risk-sharing transactions. Our mortgage group includes direct mortgage insurance in the U.S. primarily through Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (together, Arch MI U.S.); mortgage reinsurance through Arch Re Bermuda to mortgage insurers on both a proportional and non-proportional basis globally; direct mortgage insurance in Europe through Arch Insurance (EU) and in Hong Kong through Arch MI Asia; and participation in various GSE credit risk-sharing products primarily through Arch Re Bermuda.

Net premiums written for 2019 were 9.0 % higher than in the 2018 period and reflected an increase in monthly premium business due to growth in insurance in force. The persistency rate of the primary portfolio of mortgage loans of Arch MI U.S. was 75.7% at December 31, 2019 compared to 81.5% at December 31, 2018 . The persistency rate represents the percentage of mortgage insurance in force at the beginning of a 12-month period that remains in force at the end of such period. Net Premiums Earned . The following table sets forth our mortgage segments net premiums earned by underwriting location ( i.e. , where the business is underwritten): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Net premiums earned by underwriting location United States $ 1,134,849 $ 1,009,765 Other 231,491 176,471 Total $ 1,366,340 $ 1,186,236 Net premiums earned for 2019 were 15.2 % higher than in 2018 . The increase in net premiums earned reflected the growth in insurance in force in the U.S. over the last twelve months combined with higher single premium earned as a result of policy terminations due to mortgage refinance activity. Other Underwriting Income . Other underwriting income, which is primarily related to GSE risk-sharing transactions receiving derivative accounting treatment, was $16.0 million for 2019 , compared to $13.0 million for 2018 . ARCH CAPITAL 62 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . The table below shows the components of the mortgage segments loss ratio: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Current year 13.1 % 16.0 % Prior period reserve development (9.2 )% (9.1 )% Loss ratio 3.9 % 6.9 % Unlike property and casualty business for which we estimate ultimate losses on premiums earned, losses on mortgage insurance business are only recorded at the time a borrower is delinquent on their mortgage, in accordance with primary mortgage insurance industry practice. Because our primary mortgage insurance reserving process does not take into account the impact of future losses from loans that are not delinquent, mortgage insurance loss reserves are not an estimate of ultimate losses. In addition to establishing loss reserves for delinquent loans, under GAAP, we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve for our mortgage insurance products if the amount of expected future losses and maintenance costs exceeds expected future premiums, existing reserves and the anticipated investment income for such product. We assess the need for a premium deficiency reserve on a quarterly basis and perform a full analysis annually. No such reserve was established during 2019 and 2018 . Current Year Loss Ratio . The mortgage segments current year loss ratio was 2.9 points lower in 2019 compared to 2018 . The current year loss ratio for 2019 reflects the current favorable macroeconomic environment as the percentage of loans in default on first lien business decreased from 1.60% at December 31, 2018 to 1.54% at December 31, 2019. We insure mortgages for homes in areas that have been impacted by catastrophic events, including 2018 events such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the California wildfires. Generally, mortgage insurance losses occur only when a credit event occurs and, following a physical damage event, when the home is restored to pre-storm condition. Our ultimate claims exposure will depend on the number of delinquency notices received and the ultimate claim rate related to such notices. In the event of natural disasters, cure rates are influenced by the adequacy of homeowners and flood insurance carried on a related property, and a borrower's access to aid from government entities and private organizations, in addition to other factors which generally impact cure rates in unaffected areas. Prior Period Reserve Development . The mortgage segments net favorable development was $125.2 million , or 9.2 points, for 2019 , compared to $107.6 million , or 9.1 points, for 2018 . See note 5, Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about the mortgage segments prior year reserve development. Underwriting Expenses . The underwriting expense ratio for the mortgage segment was 21.0% for 2019 , compared to 22.0% for 2018 . The lower ratio in the 2019 period primarily resulted from the higher level of net premiums earned. Corporate (Non-Underwriting) Segment The corporate (non-underwriting) segment results include net investment income, other income (loss), corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, items related to our non-cumulative preferred shares, net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses included in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes. Such amounts exclude the results of the other segment. Net Investment Income. The components of net investment income were derived from the following sources: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Fixed maturities $ 440,824 $ 403,449 Equity securities 13,455 12,650 Short-term investments 14,642 17,802 Other (1) 86,440 70,946 Gross investment income 555,361 504,847 Investment expenses (2) (64,294 ) (66,889 ) Net investment income $ 491,067 $ 437,958 (1) Amounts include dividends and other distributions on investment funds, term loan investments, funds held balances, cash balances and other. (2) Investment expenses were approximately 0.33% of average invested assets for 2019 , compared to 0.36% for 2018 . The pre-tax investment income yield was 2.52% for 2019 , compared to 2.36% for 2018 . The higher level of net investment income for 2019 compared to 2018 reflected a higher level of income on fund investments and the reinvestment of fixed income securities at slightly higher available yields and the shift from municipal bonds to corporates. The pre-tax investment income yields were calculated based on amortized cost. Yields on future investment income may vary based on financial market conditions, investment allocation decisions and other factors. ARCH CAPITAL 63 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses were $65.7 million for 2019 , compared to $58.6 million for 2018 . Such amounts primarily represent certain holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company. The higher level of corporate expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs. Transaction Costs and Other. Transaction costs and other were $14.4 million for 2019 , compared to $11.4 million for 2018 . Amounts for 2019 were primarily attributable to our 2019 acquisitions, while amounts for 2018 were primarily attributable to the write off of intangible assets related to insurance licenses for a subsidiary which was merged with another subsidiary. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets for 2019 was $82.1 million , compared to $105.7 million for 2018 . Amounts in 2019 and 2018 primarily related to amortization of finite-lived intangible assets related to our 2016 acquisition. Interest Expense . Interest expense was $93.7 million for 2019 , compared to $101.0 million for 2018 . Interest expense reflects amounts related to our outstanding senior notes, revolving credit agreement borrowings and other. We repaid $375 million of our revolving credit agreement borrowings during 2018 resulting in lower borrowing costs for 2019. Loss on Redemption of Preferred Shares. In January 2018, we redeemed the remaining $92.3 million of 6.75% Series C preferred shares outstanding and recorded a loss of $2.7 million. Such adjustments had no impact on total shareholders equity or cash flows. Net Realized Gains (Losses). We recorded net realized gains of $351.2 million for 2019 , compared to net realized losses of $284.4 million for 2018 . Currently, our portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines. The effect of financial market movements on the investment portfolio will directly impact net realized gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced. Net realized gains or losses from the sale of fixed maturities primarily results from our decisions to reduce credit exposure, to change duration targets, to rebalance our portfolios or due to relative value determinations. Net realized gains or losses also includes realized and unrealized contract gains and losses on our derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for using the fair value option along with re-measurement of contingent consideration liability amounts. Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings. For 2019 , we recorded $3.2 million of credit related impairments in earnings, compared to $2.8 million in 2018 . See note 8, Investment InformationOther-Than-Temporary Impairments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method. We recorded $123.7 million of equity in net income related to investments accounted for using the equity method for 2019 , compared to $45.6 million for 2018 . Investments accounted for using the equity method totaled $1.66 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2018 . See note 8, Investment InformationEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Investments Accounted For Using the Equity Method, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. Net Foreign Exchange Gains or Losses. Net foreign exchange losses for 2019 were $9.3 million , compared to net foreign exchange gains for 2018 of $58.7 million . Amounts in such periods were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing our net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax provision on income before income taxes resulted in an expense of 8.7% for 2019 , compared to an expense of 13.1% for 2018 . Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year consistent with the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. See note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average statutory tax rate for 2019 and 2018 . Other Segment The other segment includes the results of Watford. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Watford is considered a variable interest entity and we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of Watford. As such, we consolidate the results of Watford in our consolidated financial statements, although we only own approximately 13% of Watfords common equity as of December 31, 2019 . See note ARCH CAPITAL 64 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents 11, Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests, and note 4, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including reserves), revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, insurance and other reserves, reinsurance recoverables, allowance for doubtful accounts, investment valuations, goodwill and intangible assets, bad debts, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, where possible, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Loss Reserves We are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and GAAP to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, or Loss Reserves, that arise from the business we underwrite. Loss Reserves for our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage operations are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. Loss Reserves do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences. Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial. See note 6, Short Duration Contracts, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our reserving process. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , our Loss Reserves, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, by type and by operating segment were as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Insurance segment: Case reserves $ 1,601,627 $ 1,489,644 IBNR reserves 3,403,051 3,266,796 Total net reserves 5,004,678 4,756,440 Reinsurance segment: Case reserves 1,273,523 1,082,917 Additional case reserves 166,251 191,002 IBNR reserves 1,835,993 1,578,907 Total net reserves 3,275,767 2,852,826 Mortgage segment: Case reserves 266,030 355,606 IBNR reserves 157,712 122,304 Total net reserves (1) 423,742 477,910 Other segment: Case reserves 478,036 364,052 Additional case reserves 29,059 36,512 IBNR reserves 597,910 551,266 Total net reserves 1,105,005 951,830 Total: Case reserves 3,619,216 3,292,219 Additional case reserves 195,310 227,514 IBNR reserves 5,994,666 5,519,273 Total net reserves $ 9,809,192 $ 9,039,006 (1) At December 31, 2019 , total net reserves include $278.7 million from U.S. primary mortgage insurance business, of which 57.8% represents policy years 2009 and prior and the remainder from later policy years. At December 31, 2018 , total net reserves include $375.8 million from U.S. primary mortgage insurance business, of which 73.4% represents policy years 2009 and prior and the remainder from later policy years.

Potential Variability in Loss Reserves The tables below summarize the effect of reasonably likely scenarios on the key actuarial assumptions used to estimate our Loss Reserves, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, at December 31, 2019 by underwriting segment (excluding the other segment). The scenarios shown in the tables summarize the effect of (i) changes to the expected loss ratio selections used at December 31, 2019 , which represent loss ratio point increases or decreases to the expected loss ratios used, and (ii) changes to the loss development patterns used in our reserving process at December 31, 2019 , which represent claims reporting that is either slower or faster than the reporting patterns used. We believe that the illustrated sensitivities are indicative of the potential variability inherent in the estimation process of those parameters. The results show the impact of varying each key actuarial assumption using the chosen sensitivity on our IBNR reserves, on a net basis and across all accident years.

In addition, the potential variability shown in the tables above are reasonably likely scenarios of changes in our key assumptions at December 31, 2019 and are not meant to be a best case or worst case series of outcomes and, therefore, it is possible that future variations may be more or less than the amounts set forth above. For our mortgage segment, we considered the sensitivity of loss reserve estimates at December 31, 2019 by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in severity and default to claim rate. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, for every one percentage point change in primary claim severity (which we estimate to be 30% of the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2019 ), we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately $14.0 million at December 31, 2019 . For every one percentage point change in our primary net default to claim rate (which we estimate to be approximately 25% at December 31, 2019 ), we estimated a $17.0 million change in our loss reserves at December 31, 2019 . Simulation Results In order to illustrate the potential volatility in our Loss Reserves, we used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to simulate a range of results based on various probabilities. Both the probabilities and related modeling are subject to inherent uncertainties. The simulation relies on a significant number of assumptions, such as the potential for multiple entities to react similarly to external events, and includes other statistical assumptions. The simulation results shown for each segment do not add to the total simulation results, as the individual segment simulation results do not reflect the diversification effects across our segments. At December 31, 2019 , our recorded Loss Reserves by underwriting segment, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, and the results of the simulation were as follows: Insurance Segment Reinsurance Segment Mortgage Segment Total Loss Reserves (1) $5,004,678 $3,275,767 $423,742 $8,704,187 Simulation results: 90th percentile (2) $6,020,835 $4,117,091 $507,130 $10,173,177 10th percentile (3) $3,975,992 $2,548,680 $346,009 $6,777,556 (1) Net of reinsurance recoverables.

(2) Simulation results indicate that a 90% probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will not exceed the indicated amount. (3) Simulation results indicate that a 10% probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will be at or below the indicated amount. For informational purposes, based on the total simulation results, a change in our Loss Reserves to the amount indicated at the 90th percentile would result in a decrease in income before income taxes of approximately $1.47 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share, while a change in our Loss Reserves to the amount indicated at the 10th percentile would result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately $1.44 billion, or $3.47 per diluted share. The simulation results noted above are informational only, and no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the simulation results shown above, and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined. We do not have significant exposure to pre-2002 liabilities, such as asbestos-related illnesses and other long-tail liabilities. It is difficult to provide meaningful trend information for certain liability/casualty coverages for which the claim-tail may be especially long, as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years, or even decades, after the related loss events occur.

Ceded Reinsurance In the normal course of business, our insurance and mortgage insurance operations cede a portion of their premium on a quota share or excess of loss basis through treaty or facultative reinsurance agreements. Our reinsurance operations also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify it for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by our reinsurance operations. Such arrangements, where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer, are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements. In addition, our reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties, including the reinsurers, such as our reinsurance operations, and the ceding company. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, our insurance or reinsurance operations would be liable for such defaulted amounts. The availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions, which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our insurance and reinsurance operations have been successful in obtaining adequate reinsurance and retrocessional protection, it is not certain that they will be able to continue to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels. As a result of such market conditions and other factors, our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage operations may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements and may lead to increased volatility in our results of operations in future periods. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our IndustryThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2020, our insurance operations had in effect a reinsurance program which provided coverage for certain property-catastrophe related losses equal to $256 million in excess of various retentions per occurrence. For purposes of managing risk, we reinsure a portion of our exposures, paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write, and we may also use retrocessional protection. On a consolidated basis, ceded premiums written represented 25.8% of gross premiums written for 2019 , compared to 23.2% for 2018 . We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. If the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties, as appropriate. We evaluate the credit worthiness of all the reinsurers to which we cede business. If our analysis indicates that there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to collect amounts due from reinsurers, managing general agents, brokers and other clients, we will record a provision for doubtful accounts. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our CompanyWe are exposed to ARCH CAPITAL 69 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents credit risk in certain of our business operations and Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. Premium Revenues and Related Expenses Insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products, usually 12 months. Premiums written include estimates in our insurance operations programs, specialty lines, collateral protection business and for participation in involuntary pools. Such premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business, similar business and available industry information. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in-force insurance policies. Reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies, supplemented by our own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received. The determination of premium estimates requires a review of our experience with the ceding companies, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, an analysis and understanding of the characteristics of each line of business, and managements judgment of the impact of various factors, including premium or loss trends, on the volume of business written and ceded to us. On an ongoing basis, our underwriters review the amounts reported by these third parties for reasonableness based on their experience and knowledge of the subject class of business, taking into account our historical experience with the brokers or ceding companies. In addition, reinsurance contracts under which we assume business generally contain specific provisions which allow us to perform audits of the ceding company to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, including accurate and timely reporting of information. Based on a review of all available information, management establishes premium estimates where reports have not been received. Premium estimates are updated when new information is received and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined. Premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts we write. Premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten. For excess of loss contracts, premiums are recorded as written based on the terms of the contract. Estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term. Reinstatement premiums for our insurance and reinsurance operations are recognized at the time a loss event occurs, where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. Reinstatement premiums, if obligatory, are fully earned when recognized. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on an estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses, which reflects managements judgment, as described above in Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. The amount of reinsurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and the amount of related acquisition expenses by type of business were as follows at December 31, 2019 : December 31, 2019 Gross Amount Acquisition Expenses Net Amount Other specialty $ 222,881 $ (56,628 ) $ 166,253 Casualty 172,129 (53,074 ) 119,055 Property excluding property catastrophe 80,134 (27,316 ) 52,818 Marine and aviation 46,962 (12,159 ) 34,803 Property catastrophe 4,475 (814 ) 3,661 Other 64,578 (7,182 ) 57,396 Total $ 591,159 $ (157,173 ) $ 433,986 Premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly. Such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates. Based on managements review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known. Adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Based on currently available information, management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and, therefore, no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at December 31, 2019 . Reinsurance premiums assumed, irrespective of the class of business, are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts. Contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy, which is typically 12 months. Accordingly, the premium is earned evenly over the term. Contracts which are written on a risks attaching basis cover claims which attach to the underlying ARCH CAPITAL 70 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts. Premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract, typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a 24-month period. Certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts. Premiums written and earned, as well as related acquisition expenses, are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts. Retroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured. In certain instances, reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and, accordingly, we bifurcate the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and accounts for each element separately where practical. Underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately. Subsequent changes in estimated amount or timing of cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction, with a corresponding charge or credit to income. Mortgage guaranty insurance policies are contracts that are generally non-cancelable by the insurer, are renewable at a fixed price, and provide for payment of premiums on a monthly, annual or single basis. Upon renewal, we are not able to re-underwrite or re-price our policies. Consistent with industry accounting practices, premiums written on a monthly basis are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on an annual basis are amortized on a monthly pro rata basis over the year of coverage. Primary mortgage insurance premiums written on policies covering more than one year are referred to as single premiums. A portion of the revenue from single premiums is recognized in premiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated expiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies related to insured loans are canceled for any reason and the policy is a non-refundable product, the remaining unearned premium related to each canceled policy is recognized as earned premium upon notification of the cancellation. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the estimated unexpired risk of insured loans. A portion of premium payments may be refundable if the insured cancels coverage, which generally occurs when the loan is repaid, the loan amortizes to a sufficiently low amount to trigger a lender permitted or legally required cancellation, or the value of the property has increased sufficiently in accordance with the terms of the contract. Premium refunds reduce premiums earned in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, only unearned premiums are refundable. Acquisition costs that are directly related and incremental to the successful acquisition or renewal of business are deferred and amortized based on the type of contract. For property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Consistent with mortgage insurance industry accounting practice, amortization of acquisition costs related to the mortgage insurance contracts for each underwriting years book of business is recorded in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are comprised of earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses. For each underwriting year, we estimate the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. Acquisition expenses and other expenses related to our underwriting operations that vary with, and are directly related to, the successful acquisition or renewal of business are deferred and amortized based on the type of contract. Our insurance and reinsurance operations capitalize incremental direct external costs that result from acquiring a contract but do not capitalize salaries, benefits and other internal underwriting costs. For our mortgage insurance operations, which include a substantial direct sales force, both external and certain internal direct costs are deferred and amortized. Deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, based on historical and current experience, and anticipated investment income. A premium deficiency occurs if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs and anticipated investment income exceed unearned premiums. A premium deficiency reserve (PDR) is recorded by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required in order to eliminate the deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds unamortized acquisition costs then a liability is accrued for the excess deficiency. To assess the need for a PDR on our mortgage exposures, we develop loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to our current policies in force. This projection is based on recent trends in default experience, severity and rates of defaulted loans moving to claim, as well as recent trends in the rate at which loans are prepaid, and incorporates anticipated interest income. Evaluating the expected profitability of our existing mortgage insurance business and the need for a PDR for our mortgage business involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of potential losses and premium revenues. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to evaluate the need for a PDR may prove to be inaccurate, ARCH CAPITAL 71 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty.

Investable Assets Held by Arch The Finance, Investment and Risk Committee (FIR) of our board of directors establishes our investment policies and sets the parameters for creating guidelines for our investment managers. The FIR reviews the implementation of the investment strategy on a regular basis. Our current approach stresses preservation of capital, market liquidity and diversification of risk. While maintaining our emphasis on preservation of capital and liquidity, we expect our portfolio to become more diversified and, as a result, we may expand into areas which are not currently part of our investment strategy.

(4) Over 90% of such amount is collateralized through reinsurance trusts or letters of credit. Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses We establish reserves for losses and LAE (Loss Reserves) which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. Estimating Loss Reserves is inherently difficult, which is exacerbated by the fact that we have relatively limited historical experience upon which to base such estimates. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of Loss Reserves. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting PronouncementsLoss Reserves and see Item 1BusinessReserves for further details. Shareholders Equity and Book Value per Share Total shareholders equity available to Arch was $11.50 billion at December 31, 2019 , compared to $9.44 billion at December 31, 2018 . The increase in 2019 was primarily attributable to underwriting, strong investment returns and a lower level of catastrophic activity. The following table presents the calculation of book value per share: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except share data) December 31, 2019 2018 Total shareholders equity available to Arch $ 11,497,371 $ 9,439,827 Less preferred shareholders equity 780,000 780,000 Common shareholders equity available to Arch $ 10,717,371 $ 8,659,827 Common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, net of treasury shares (1) 405,619,201 402,454,834 Book value per share $ 26.42 $ 21.52 (1) Excludes the effects of 18,853,018 and 20,076,593 stock options and 1,586,779 and 1,307,304 restricted stock and performance units outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. LIQUIDITY This section does not include information specific to Watford. We do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford, and our financial exposure to Watford is limited to our investment in Watfords senior notes, common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from reinsurance transactions with Watford. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations. Arch Capital is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries. Generally, Arch Capital depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred and common shares. In 2019 , Arch Capital received dividends of $116.9 million from Arch Re Bermuda, our Bermuda-based reinsurer and insurer which can pay approximately $3.1 billion to Arch Capital in 2020 without providing an affidavit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Arch-U.S. received $465.0 million of dividends from Arch U.S. MI Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Arch-U.S. ARCH CAPITAL 75 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time losses are paid. The period of time from the occurrence of a claim through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future. Sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. As part of our investment strategy, we seek to establish a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities which, combined with expected cash flow, is believed by us to be adequate to meet our foreseeable payment obligations. However, due to the nature of our operations, cash flows are affected by claim payments that may comprise large payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate from year to year. We believe that our liquid investments and cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claim payment obligations. However, the timing and amounts of actual claim payments related to recorded Loss Reserves vary based on many factors, including large individual losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions. The ultimate amount of the claim payments could differ materially from our estimated amounts. Certain lines of business written by us, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. The foregoing may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns. The impact of this variability can be exacerbated by the fact that the timing of the receipt of reinsurance recoverables owed to us may be slower than anticipated by us. Therefore, the irregular timing of claim payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods and may require us to utilize other sources of liquidity to make these payments, which may include the sale of investments or utilization of existing or new credit facilities or capital market transactions. If the source of liquidity is the sale of investments, we may be forced to sell such investments at a loss, which may be material. We expect that our liquidity needs, including our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs, for the next twelve months, at a minimum, will be met by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, as well as by our balance of cash, short-term investments, proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments, and our credit facilities. Dividend Restrictions Arch Capital has no material restrictions on its ability to make distributions to shareholders. However, the ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us is limited by the applicable local laws and relevant regulations of the various countries and states in which we operate. See note 24, Statutory Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on dividend restrictions. The payment of dividends from Arch Re Bermuda is, under certain circumstances, limited under Bermuda law, which requires our Bermuda operating subsidiary to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. Our U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. These regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to shareholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. Each state requires prior regulatory approval of any payment of extraordinary dividends. We also have insurance subsidiaries that are the parent company for other insurance subsidiaries, which means that dividends and other distributions will be subject to multiple layers of regulations in order for our insurance subsidiaries to be able to dividend funds to Arch Capital. The inability of the subsidiaries of Arch Capital to pay dividends and other permitted distributions could have a material adverse effect on Arch Capitals cash requirements and our ability to make principal, interest and dividend payments on the senior notes, preferred shares and common shares. In addition to meeting applicable regulatory standards, the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is also constrained by our dependence on the financial strength ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries from independent rating agencies. The ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. We believe that Arch Capital has sufficient cash resources and available dividend capacity to service its indebtedness and other current outstanding obligations. Restricted Assets Our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain assets on deposit, which primarily consist of fixed maturities, with various regulatory authorities to support their operations. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third ARCH CAPITAL 76 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents parties. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain assets in trust accounts as collateral for insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated companies and also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , such amounts approximated $6.80 billion and $6.76 billion , respectively, excluding amounts related to the other segment. Our investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income and structured securities, investments in funds accounted for using the equity method, other alternative investments and investments in ventures such as Watford and others may be illiquid due to contractual provisions or investment market conditions. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, then we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or may be forced to sell or terminate them at unfavorable values. Our unfunded investment commitments totaled approximately $1.69 billion at December 31, 2019 and are callable by our investment managers. The timing of the funding of investment commitments is uncertain and may require us to access cash on short notice. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, excluding amounts related to the other segment: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Total cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,810,060 $ 1,331,278 Investing activities (1,689,640 ) (268,734 ) Financing activities 3,663 (987,679 ) Effects of exchange rate changes on foreign currency cash 16,063 (16,383 ) Increase (decrease) in cash $ 140,146 $ 58,482  Cash provided by operating activities for 2019 was higher than in 2018 , primarily reflecting an increase in premiums collected, a lower level of net losses paid and lower purchases of tax and loss bonds. The 2018 period reflected a higher level of paid losses and purchases of tax and loss bonds.  Cash used for investing activities for 2019 was higher than in 2018 , reflecting a higher level of securities purchased.  Cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was higher than the cash used in 2018. The 2018 period reflected $375.0 million of paydowns on our revolving credit agreement borrowings, $282.8 million of repurchases under our share repurchase program and $92.6 million related to redemption of our Series C preferred shares. Investments At December 31, 2019 , our investable assets were $22.29 billion , excluding the $2.70 billion of investable assets related to the other segment. The primary goals of our asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities, manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows, including debt service obligations. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by our fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of our insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the fair value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, provide assurance of our ability to fund the payment of claims and to service our outstanding debt without having to sell securities at distressed prices or access credit facilities. Please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of other risks relating to our business and investment portfolio. CAPITAL RESOURCES This section does not include information specific to Watford.

(2) $500 million unsecured facility for revolving loans and letters of credit. Arch Capital and Arch-U.S. are each holding companies and, accordingly, they conduct substantially all of their operations through their operating subsidiaries. Arch Capital Finance LLC (Arch Finance) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arch U.S. MI Holdings Inc., a U.S. holding company. As a result, Arch Capital, Arch-U.S. and Arch Finance's cash flows and their ability to service their debt depends upon the earnings of their operating subsidiaries and on their ability to distribute the earnings, loans or other payments from such subsidiaries to Arch Capital, Arch-U.S. and Arch Finance, respectively. See note 18, Debt and Financing Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional disclosures concerning our senior notes and revolving credit agreement borrowings. For additional information on our preferred shares, see note 20, Shareholders Equity, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. During 2019 and 2018 , we made interest payments of $98.7 million and $100.1 million respectively, related to our senior notes and other financing arrangements. In November 2017, Arch Capital, Arch-U.S. and Arch Finance filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC. This registration statement allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of various types of securities, including unsecured debt securities, preference shares, common shares, warrants, share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares. The shelf registration statement enables us to efficiently access the public debt and/or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs. The shelf registration statement also allows selling shareholders to resell common shares that they own in one or more offerings from time to time. We will not receive any proceeds from any shares offered by the selling shareholders. Capital Adequacy We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and will seek to adjust our capital base (up or down) according to the needs of our business. The future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. In particular, we require (1) sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings, as issued by several ratings agencies, at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete; (2) sufficient capital to enable our underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the U.S. and other key markets; and (3) our non-U.S. operating companies are required to post letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary for them to operate as they are non-admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations. In addition, Arch MI U.S. is required to maintain compliance with the GSEs requirements, known as PMIERs. The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurers available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed minimum required assets as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value and original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans) and are subject to a minimum amount. Arch MI U.S. satisfied the PMIERs financial requirements as of December 31, 2019 with a PMIER sufficiency ratio of 161% , compared to 141% at December 31, 2018 . As part of our capital management program, we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, cash dividends or other methods (or a combination of such methods). Any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions, rating agency requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. ARCH CAPITAL 78 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. We can provide no assurance that, if needed, we would be able to obtain additional funds through financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Any adverse developments in the financial markets, such as disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, may result in realized and unrealized capital losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. In addition to common share capital, we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities, which can be in the form (or any combination) of debt securities, preference shares, common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and/or letters of credit. Arch Capital, through its subsidiaries, provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates, through certain reinsurance arrangements beneficial to the ratings of such subsidiaries. Historically, our U.S.-based insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance subsidiaries have entered into separate reinsurance arrangements with Arch Re Bermuda covering individual lines of business. The reinsurance agreements between our U.S.-based property casualty insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and Arch Re Bermuda were canceled on a cutoff basis as of January 1, 2018. As a result, the level of subject business ceded to Arch Re Bermuda was substantially lower beginning in 2018 than in prior periods. In 2019, certain reinsurance agreements between our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries were reinstated. Except as described in the above paragraph, or where express reinsurance, guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place, each of Arch Capitals subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments (and no other Arch Capital subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible). Any reinsurance arrangements, guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the Arch Capital subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties (creditors or insureds of such entity) are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements. Share Repurchase Program The board of directors of Arch Capital has authorized the investment in Arch Capitals common shares through a share repurchase program. Since the inception of the share repurchase program through December 31, 2019 , Arch Capital has repurchased approximately 386.3 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $3.97 billion . At December 31, 2019 , $1.0 billion of share repurchases were available under the program. Repurchases under the program may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2021. The timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under this program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations. We will continue to monitor our share price and, depending upon results of operations, market conditions and the development of the economy, as well as other factors, we will consider share repurchases on an opportunistic basis.

Contractual Obligations The following table provides an analysis of our contractual commitments at December 31, 2019 : Payment due by period Total 2020 2021 and 2022 2023 and 2024 Thereafter Operating activities Estimated gross payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses (1) $ 12,628,213 $ 3,612,298 $ 3,818,635 $ 1,901,186 $ 3,296,094 Deposit accounting liabilities (2) 10,431 3,814 668 822 5,127 Contractholder payables (3) 2,119,460 671,838 729,706 297,634 420,282 Operating lease obligations 170,453 31,907 58,439 39,940 40,167 Purchase obligations 55,606 29,861 20,082 4,753 910 Investing activities Unfunded investment commitments (4) 1,686,649 1,686,649    Financing activities Securities lending payable (5) 388,366 388,366    Senior notes (including interest payments) 3,435,288 90,465 180,929 180,929 2,982,965 Financing lease obligations 6,883 4,822 2,061   Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 20,501,349 $ 6,520,020 $ 4,810,520 $ 2,425,264 $ 6,745,545 (1) The estimated expected contractual commitments related to the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are presented on a gross basis ( i.e. , not reflecting any corresponding reinsurance recoverable amounts that would be due to us). It should be noted that until a claim has been presented to us, determined to be valid, quantified and settled, there is no known obligation on an individual transaction basis, and while estimable in the aggregate, the timing and amount contain significant uncertainty. (2) The estimated expected contractual commitments related to deposit accounting liabilities have been estimated using projected cash flows from the underlying contracts. It should be noted that, due to the nature of such liabilities, the timing and amount contain significant uncertainty. (3) Certain insurance policies written by our insurance operations feature large deductibles, primarily in construction and national accounts lines. Under such contracts, we are obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim and are subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. In the event we are unable to collect from the policyholder, we would be liable for such defaulted amounts. (4) Unfunded investment commitments are callable by our investment managers. We have assumed that such investments will be funded in the next year but the funding may occur over a longer period of time, due to market conditions and other factors. (5) As part of our securities lending program, we loan securities to third parties and receive collateral in the form of cash or securities. Such collateral is due back to the third parties at the close of the securities lending transactions, a majority of which is overnight and continuous by nature. Letter of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities In the normal course of its operations, the Company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain secured and unsecured credit facilities. On December 17, 2019 Arch Capital and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an $750.0 million five-year credit facility (the Credit Facility) with a syndication of lenders. The Credit Facility consists of a $250.0 million secured facility for letters of credit (the Secured Facility) and a $500.0 million unsecured facility for revolving loans and letters of credit (the Unsecured Facility). Obligations of each borrower under the Secured Facility for letters of credit are secured by cash and eligible securities of such borrower held in collateral accounts. Commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased up to, but not exceeding, an aggregate of $1.25 billion . Arch Capital has a one-time option to convert any or all outstanding revolving loans of Arch Capital and/or Arch-U.S. to term loans with the same terms as the revolving loans except that any prepayments may not be re-borrowed. Arch-U.S. guarantees the obligations of Arch Capital, and Arch Capital guarantees the obligations of Arch-U.S. Borrowings of revolving loans may be made at a variable rate based on LIBOR or an alternative base rate at the option of Arch Capital. Secured letters of credit are available for issuance on behalf of Arch Capital insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is structured such that each party that requests a letter of credit or borrowing does so only for itself and for only its own obligations. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on indebtedness, consolidated tangible net worth, minimum ARCH CAPITAL 80 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents shareholders equity levels and minimum financial strength ratings. Arch Capital and its subsidiaries which are party to the agreement were in compliance with all covenants contained therein at December 31, 2019 . Under the $250.0 million secured letter of credit facility, Arch Capitals subsidiaries had $225.4 million of letters of credit outstanding and remaining capacity of $24.6 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, certain of Arch Capitals subsidiaries had outstanding secured and unsecured letters of credit of $18.1 million and $195.0 million respectively, which were issued in the normal course of business. There were no outstanding revolving credit agreement borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018. RATINGS Our ability to underwrite business is affected by the quality of our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies. Such ratings from third party internationally recognized statistical rating organizations or agencies are instrumental in establishing the financial security of companies in our industry. We believe that the primary users of such ratings include commercial and investment banks, policyholders, brokers, ceding companies and investors. Insurance ratings are also used by insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers, and are often an important factor in the decision by an insured or intermediary of whether to place business with a particular insurance or reinsurance provider. Periodically, rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for the ratings assigned to us by them. S&P, Moodys, A.M. Best Company and Fitch Ratings are ratings agencies which have assigned financial strength ratings to one or more of Arch Capitals subsidiaries. If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could include, among other things, the following possible outcomes: (1) potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries, which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher-rated competitors; (2) reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy-based tests enforced by statutory agencies; and (3) any resultant ratings downgrades could, among other things, affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit. In addition, under certain of the reinsurance agreements assumed by our reinsurance operations, upon the occurrence of a ratings downgrade or other specified triggering event with respect to our reinsurance operations, such as a reduction in surplus by specified amounts during specified periods, our ceding company clients may be provided with certain rights, including, among other things, the right to terminate the subject reinsurance agreement and/or to require that our reinsurance operations post additional collateral. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our Internet site ( www.ir.archcapgroup.com , under Credit Ratings) contains information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND SEVERE ECONOMIC EVENTS We have large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made catastrophic events and severe economic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, droughts and other natural disasters. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as mortgage insurance, workers compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration, tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time. We have substantial exposure to unexpected, large losses resulting from future man-made catastrophic events, such as acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. These risks are inherently unpredictable. It is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. It is not possible to completely eliminate our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and, to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Therefore, claims for natural and man-made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations, which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely. In certain instances, we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism. Even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us, we may not be successful in doing so. Moreover, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us. We seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written. In the case of ARCH CAPITAL 81 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents proportional treaties, we may seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one or series of events. In our insurance operations, we seek to limit our exposure through the purchase of reinsurance. We cannot be certain that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective. We also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. Geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone's limits. There can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, will be enforceable in the manner we intend. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise. Underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders' equity. For our natural catastrophe exposed business, we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses from a single event in any geographic zone. We monitor our exposure to catastrophic events, including earthquake and wind and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss for such exposures. Our estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques, but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures. Our models employ both proprietary and vendor-based systems and include cross-line correlations for property, marine, offshore energy, aviation, workers compensation and personal accident. We seek to limit the probable maximum pre-tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events. Currently, we seek to limit our 1-in-250 year return period net probable maximum loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately 25% of total shareholders equity available to Arch. We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. Based on in-force exposure estimated as of January 1, 2020 , our modeled peak zone catastrophe exposure is a windstorm affecting the Florida Tri-County, with a net probable maximum pre-tax loss of $612 million , followed by windstorms affecting Northeastern U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico with net probable maximum pre-tax losses of $544 million and $521 million , respectively. Our exposures to other perils, such as U.S. earthquake and international events, were less than the exposures arising from U.S. windstorms and hurricanes in both periods. As of January 1, 2020 , our modeled peak zone earthquake exposure (San Francisco area earthquake) represented approximately 70% of our peak zone catastrophe exposure, and our modeled peak zone international exposure (Japan earthquake) was substantially less than both our peak zone windstorm and earthquake exposures. We also have significant exposure to losses due to mortgage defaults resulting from severe economic events in the future. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, we have developed a proprietary risk model (Realistic Disaster Scenario or RDS) that simulates the maximum loss resulting from a severe economic downturn impacting the housing market. The RDS models the collective impact of adverse conditions for key economic indicators, the most significant of which is a decline in home prices. The RDS model projects paths of future home prices, unemployment rates, income levels and interest rates and assumes correlation across states and geographic regions. The resulting future performance of our in-force portfolio is then estimated under the economic stress scenario, reflecting loan and borrower information. Currently, we seek to limit our modeled RDS loss from a severe economic event to approximately 25% of total tangible shareholders equity available to Arch (total shareholders equity available to Arch less goodwill and intangible assets). We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. Based on in-force exposure estimated as of January 1, 2020 , our modeled RDS loss was 8% of tangible shareholders equity available to Arch. Net probable maximum loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries, before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums. RDS loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries and after income tax. Catastrophe loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio. Since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls, our catastrophe loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones. Our catastrophe loss estimates and RDS loss estimates do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates. There can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre-tax losses greater than 25% of our total shareholders' equity or tangible shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events or severe economic events due to several factors, including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders' equity exposed to a single catastrophic event or severe economic event. In addition, actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. See Risk FactorsRisk Relating to Our Industry. Depending on business ARCH CAPITAL 82 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage portfolios, we may seek to adjust our self-imposed limitations on probable maximum pre-tax loss for catastrophe exposed business and mortgage default exposed business. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Recent Accounting PronouncementsCeded Reinsurance for a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance programs. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into various aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreements with various special purpose reinsurance companies domiciled in Bermuda. These are special purpose variable interest entities that are not consolidated in our financial results because we do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to its economic performance. As of December 31, 2019 , our estimated off-balance sheet maximum exposure to loss from such entities was $42.1 million . See note 11, Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Our investment results are subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to changes in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest, as well as changes in general economic conditions and overall market conditions. We are also exposed to potential loss from various market risks, including changes in equity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In accordance with the SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 48, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 . Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and consists of several components, including liquidity, basis and price risks. The sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2019 presents hypothetical losses in cash flows, earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on December 31, 2019 and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices. This risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. We have not included Watford in the following analyses as we do not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford, and our financial exposure to Watford is limited to our investment in Watfords senior notes, common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. The focus of the SECs market risk rules is on price risk. For purposes of specific risk analysis, we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments. The financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our investments and cash. Investment Market Risk Fixed Income Securities . We invest in interest rate sensitive securities, primarily debt securities. We consider the effect of interest rate movements on the market value of our fixed maturities, fixed maturities pledged under securities lending agreements, short-term investments and certain of our other investments which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As interest rates rise, the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities falls, and the converse is also true. Based on historical observations, there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time. Furthermore, at times interest rate movements in certain credit sectors exhibit a much lower correlation to changes in U.S. Treasury yields. Accordingly, the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the following tables. The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 : (U.S. dollars in billions) Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -100 -50 - 50 100 Dec. 31, 2019 Total fair value $ 21.54 $ 21.19 $ 20.83 $ 20.48 $ 20.13 Change from base 3.4 % 1.7 % (1.7 )% (3.4 )% Change in unrealized value $ 0.71 $ 0.35 $ (0.35 ) $ (0.71 ) Dec. 31, 2018 Total fair value $ 19.23 $ 18.91 $ 18.62 $ 18.30 $ 17.98 Change from base 3.3 % 1.6 % (1.7 )% (3.4 )% Change in unrealized value $ 0.61 $ 0.30 $ (0.32 ) $ (0.63 ) In addition, we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our fixed maturities, fixed maturities ARCH CAPITAL 83 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents pledged under securities lending agreements, short-term investments and certain of our other investments and investments accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As credit spreads widen, the fair value of our fixed income securities falls, and the converse is also true. The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on the portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 : (U.S. dollars in billions) Credit Spread Shift in Percentage -100 -50 - 50 100 Dec. 31, 2019 Total fair value $ 21.19 $ 21.02 $ 20.83 $ 20.65 $ 20.48 Change from base 1.7 % 0.9 % (0.9 )% (1.7 )% Change in unrealized value $ 0.35 $ 0.19 $ (0.19 ) $ (0.35 ) Dec. 31, 2018 Total fair value $ 19.08 $ 18.84 $ 18.62 $ 18.39 $ 18.15 Change from base 2.5 % 1.2 % (1.2 )% (2.5 )% Change in unrealized value $ 0.47 $ 0.22 $ (0.22 ) $ (0.47 ) Another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR attempts to take into account a broad cross-section of risks facing a portfolio by utilizing relevant securities volatility data skewed towards the most recent months and quarters. VaR measures the amount of a portfolio at risk for outcomes 1.65 standard deviations from the mean based on normal market conditions over a one year time horizon and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolios initial value. In other words, 95% of the time, should the risks taken into account in the VaR model perform per their historical tendencies, the portfolios loss in any one year period is expected to be less than or equal to the calculated VaR, stated as a percentage of the measured portfolios initial value. As of December 31, 2019 , our portfolios VaR was estimated to be 2.80% , compared to an estimated 3.02% at December 31, 2018 . Equity Securities, Privately Held Securities and Other Investments. Our investment portfolio includes an allocation to equity securities, privately held securities and certain other investments. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the fair value of our investments in equity securities, privately held securities and certain other investments totaled $827.8 million and $368.8 million , respectively. These securities are exposed to price risk, which is the potential loss arising from decreases in fair value. An immediate hypothetical 10% depreciation in the value of each position would reduce the fair value of such investments by approximately $82.8 million and $36.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and would have decreased book value per share by approximately $0.20 and $0.09 , respectively. Investment-Related Derivatives. At December 31, 2019 , the notional value of all derivative instruments (excluding to-be-announced mortgage backed securities which are included in the fixed income securities analysis above and foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below) was $8.04 billion , compared to $4.95 billion at December 31, 2018 . If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at December 31, 2019 depreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately $80.4 million , and a decrease in book value per share of $0.20 , compared to $49.5 million and $0.12 , respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2018 . If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at December 31, 2019 appreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately $80.4 million , and an increase in book value per share of $0.20 , compared to $49.5 million and $0.12 , respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2018 . See note 10, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional disclosures concerning derivatives. For further discussion on investment activity, please refer to Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial ConditionInvestable Assets. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries, we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy. See note 10, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. ARCH CAPITAL 84 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of our net foreign currency exchange exposures, as well as foreign currency derivatives in place to manage these exposures: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share data) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Net assets (liabilities), denominated in foreign currencies, excluding shareholders equity and derivatives $ 265,501 $ (561,311 ) Shareholders equity denominated in foreign currencies (1) 744,690 478,678 Net foreign currency forward contracts outstanding (2) 81,731 241,442 Net exposures denominated in foreign currencies $ 1,091,922 $ 158,809 Pre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies: Shareholders equity $ (109,192 ) $ (15,881 ) Book value per share $ (0.27 ) $ (0.04 ) Pre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% decline of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies: Shareholders equity $ 109,192 $ 15,881 Book value per share $ 0.27 $ 0.04 (1) Represents capital contributions held in the foreign currencies of our operating units. (2) Represents the net notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. Although the Company generally attempts to match the currency of its projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, from time to time the Company may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies, which could increase the Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of the Companys shareholders equity. Historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the U.S. Dollar in the same direction and at the same time and, accordingly, the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above. For further discussion on foreign exchange activity, please refer to Results of Operations. Effects of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest rates. The potential exists, after a catastrophe loss, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy. The anticipated effects of inflation on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled. ITEM 7A.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arch Capital Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ARCH CAPITAL 87 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses As described in Notes 3, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2019, the Companys total reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses was $13.9 billion. For the insurance and reinsurance segments, management estimates ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. Management makes a number of key assumptions in their reserving process, including estimating loss development patterns and expected loss ratios. For the mortgage segment, the lead actuarial methodology used by management is a frequency-severity method based on the inventory of pending delinquencies. The assumptions of frequency and severity reflect judgments based on historical data and experience. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management when developing their estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment in performing procedures relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, (ii) there was significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence relating to the aforementioned key actuarial methods and key assumptions, and (iii) the audit effort included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over the selection of key actuarial methods and development of key assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures, including (i) developing an independent estimate, on a test basis, of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and comparing the independent estimate to managements actuarially determined reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses to evaluate the reasonableness of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial methods and reasonableness of the assumptions, including loss development patterns, expected loss ratios, frequency, and severity used by management to determine the Companys reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Developing the independent estimate and evaluating the appropriateness of the key methods and reasonableness of the key assumptions related to loss development patterns, expected loss ratios, frequency and severity, as applicable, involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical data provided by management. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 28, 2020 We have served as the Companys or its predecessors auditor since 1995.

Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include the accounts of Arch Capital and its subsidiaries, including Arch Reinsurance Ltd. (Arch Re Bermuda), Arch Reinsurance Company (Arch Re U.S.), Arch-U.S., Arch Insurance Company, Arch Specialty Insurance Company, Arch Excess & Surplus Insurance Company, Arch Indemnity Insurance Company, Arch Insurance Canada Ltd. (Arch Insurance Canada), Arch Reinsurance Europe Underwriting Designated Activity Company (Arch Re Europe), Arch Mortgage Insurance Company, Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, Arch Insurance (EU) Designated Activity Company (formerly, Arch Mortgage Insurance Designated Activity Company) (Arch Insurance (EU)), Arch Insurance (UK) Limited (formerly Arch Insurance Company (Europe) Limited)(Arch Insurance (U.K.)), Lloyds of London syndicate 2012 and related companies (Arch Syndicate 2012), Barbican and Watford. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. The Companys principal estimates include:  The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses;  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including the provision for uncollectible amounts;  Estimates of written and earned premiums;  The valuation of the investment portfolio and assessment of other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI);  The valuation of purchased intangible assets;  The assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment; and  the valuation of deferred tax assets. The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior year information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the Companys net income, shareholders equity or cash flows. In 2018, the shareholders approved a three -for-one stock split of the Company's common shares. All historical share and per share amounts reflect the effect of the stock split. ARCH CAPITAL 94 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (b) Premium Revenues and Related Expenses Insurance. Insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies for all products, usually 12 months . Premiums written include estimates in the Companys programs, specialty lines, lenders products business and for participation in involuntary pools. Such premium estimates are derived from multiple sources which include the historical experience of the underlying business, similar business and available industry information. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in-force insurance policies. Reinsurance. Reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by brokers and ceding companies, supplemented by the Companys own estimates of premiums where reports have not been received. The determination of premium estimates requires a review of the Companys experience with the ceding companies, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, an analysis and understanding of the characteristics of each line of business, and managements judgment of the impact of various factors, including premium or loss trends, on the volume of business written and ceded to the Company. On an ongoing basis, the Companys underwriters review the amounts reported by these third parties for reasonableness based on their experience and knowledge of the subject class of business, taking into account the Companys historical experience with the brokers or ceding companies. In addition, reinsurance contracts under which the Company assumes business generally contain specific provisions which allow the Company to perform audits of the ceding company to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, including accurate and timely reporting of information. Based on a review of all available information, management establishes premium estimates where reports have not been received. Premium estimates are updated when new information is received and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined. Reinsurance premiums written are recorded based on the type of contracts the Company writes. Premiums on the Companys excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten. For excess of loss contracts, premiums are recorded as written based on the terms of the contract. Estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term. Reinstatement premiums for the Companys insurance and reinsurance operations are recognized at the time a loss event occurs, where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. Reinstatement premiums, if obligatory, are fully earned when recognized. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on an estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses, which reflects managements judgment. Premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly. Such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates. Based on managements review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known. Adjustments to premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the estimated premium may be fully or substantially earned. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Reinsurance premiums written, irrespective of the class of business, are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts. Contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover claims that may occur during the term of the contract or policy, which is typically 12 months . Accordingly, the premium is earned evenly over the term. Contracts which are written on a risks attaching basis cover claims which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such contracts. Premiums earned on such contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract, typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a 24 -month period. Certain of the Companys reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts. Premiums written and earned, as well as related acquisition expenses, are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts. The Company also writes certain reinsurance business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance. Under these contracts, the Company assumes a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for an anticipated margin, which is typically lower than on traditional reinsurance contracts. The terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience, loss corridors, sublimits and caps. Examples of such business include aggregate stop-loss coverages, financial quota share coverages and multi-year ARCH CAPITAL 95 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS retrospectively rated excess of loss coverages. If these contracts are deemed to transfer risk, they are accounted for as reinsurance. Otherwise, such contracts are accounted for under the deposit method. Mortgage. Mortgage guaranty insurance policies are contracts that are generally non-cancelable by the insurer, are renewable at a fixed price, and provide for payment of premiums on a monthly, annual or single basis. Upon renewal, the Company is not able to re-underwrite or re-price its policies. Consistent with industry accounting practices, premiums written on a monthly basis are earned as coverage is provided. Premiums written on an annual basis are amortized on a monthly pro rata basis over the year of coverage. Primary mortgage insurance premiums written on policies covering more than one year are referred to as single premiums. A portion of the revenue from single premiums is recognized in premiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated expiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies related to insured loans are canceled due to repayment by the borrower and the policy is a non-refundable product, the remaining unearned premium related to each canceled policy is recognized as earned premium upon notification of the cancellation. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the estimated unexpired risk of insured loans. A portion of premium payments may be refundable if the insured cancels coverage, which generally occurs when the loan is repaid, the loan amortizes to a sufficiently low amount to trigger a lender permitted or legally required cancellation, or the value of the property has increased sufficiently in accordance with the terms of the contract. Premium refunds reduce premiums earned in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, only unearned premiums are refundable. Acquisition Costs. Acquisition costs that are directly related and incremental to the successful acquisition or renewal of business are deferred and amortized based on the type of contract. The Companys insurance and reinsurance operations capitalize incremental direct external costs that result from acquiring a contract but do not capitalize salaries, benefits and other internal underwriting costs. For the Companys mortgage insurance operations, which include a substantial direct sales force, both external and certain internal direct costs are deferred and amortized. For property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Consistent with mortgage insurance industry accounting practice, amortization of acquisition costs related to the mortgage insurance contracts for each underwriting years book of business is recorded in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are comprised of earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses. For each underwriting year, the Company estimates the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. Deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, based on historical and current experience, and anticipated investment income. A premium deficiency occurs if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceed unearned premiums (including expected future premiums) and anticipated investment income. A premium deficiency reserve (PDR) is recorded by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required in order to eliminate the deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds unamortized acquisition costs then a liability is accrued for the excess deficiency. To assess the need for a PDR on mortgage exposures, the Company develops loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to its current policies in force. This projection is based on recent trends in default experience, severity and rates of defaulted loans moving to claim, as well as recent trends in the rate at which loans are prepaid, and incorporates anticipated interest income. Evaluating the expected profitability of the Companys existing mortgage insurance business and the need for a PDR for its mortgage business involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of potential losses and premium revenues. No premium deficiency charges were recorded by the Company during 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . (c) Deposit Accounting Certain assumed reinsurance contracts that are deemed not to transfer insurance risk, are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. However, it is possible that the Company could incur financial losses on such contracts. Management exercises significant judgment in the assumptions used in determining whether assumed contracts should be accounted for as reinsurance contracts or deposit contracts. For those contracts that contain only significant underwriting risk, the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in the Companys underwriting results. When the estimated profit margin is explicit, the margin is reflected as other underwriting income and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses. When the estimated profit margin is implicit, the margin is reflected as an offset to paid losses and any adverse financial results on such contracts are reflected as incurred losses. Additional judgments are required when applying the accounting guidance with respect to the revenue recognition criteria for contracts deemed to transfer only significant underwriting risk. For those contracts that contain only ARCH CAPITAL 96 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS significant timing risk, an accretion rate is established at inception of the contract based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit accounting liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the contract term. The accretion on the deposit is based on the expected rate of return required to fund the expected future payment obligations. Periodically the Company reassesses the estimated ultimate liability and the related expected rate of return. The accretion of the deposit accounting liability as well as changes to the estimated ultimate liability and the accretion rate would be reflected as part of interest expense in the Companys results of operations. Any negative accretion in a deposit accounting liability is shown in other underwriting income in the Companys results of operations. Under some of these contracts, the ceding company retains the related assets on a funds-held basis. Such amounts are included in Other assets on the Companys balance sheet. Interest income produced by those assets are recorded as part of net investment income in the Company's results of operations. (d) Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance reimburses a ceding company for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events covered by the underlying policies reinsured. In certain instances, reinsurance contracts cover losses both on a prospective basis and on a retroactive basis and, accordingly, the Company bifurcates the prospective and retrospective elements of these reinsurance contracts and accounts for each element separately where practical. Underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive reinsurance contracts is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period while losses are charged to income immediately. Subsequent changes in estimated amount or timing of cash flows under such retroactive reinsurance contracts are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction, with a corresponding charge or credit to income. (e) Reinsurance Ceded In the normal course of business, the Company purchases reinsurance to increase capacity and to limit the impact of individual losses and events on its underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers. The Company uses pro rata, excess of loss and facultative reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance ceding commissions that represent a recovery of acquisition costs are recognized as a reduction to acquisition costs while the remaining portion is deferred. The accompanying consolidated statement of income reflects premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs, net of reinsurance ceded. See note 7, Reinsurance for information on the Company's reinsurance usage. Reinsurance premiums ceded and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable are estimated in a manner consistent with that of the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, the Companys insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. (f) Cash Cash includes cash equivalents, which are investments with original maturities of three months or less which are not part of the investment portfolio. (g) Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts held for the benefit of third parties and is legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage by the Company. Such amounts are included in Other assets on the Companys balance sheet. (h) Investments The Company currently classifies substantially all of its fixed maturity investments and short-term investments as available for sale and, accordingly, they are carried at estimated fair value (also known as fair value) with the changes in fair value recorded as an unrealized gain or loss component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities is generally determined from quotations received from nationally recognized pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. Short-term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue. Short-term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of investment portfolios under the management of external and internal investment managers. The Company enters into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income whereby it loans certain of its securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms, for short periods of time through a lending agent. Such securities have been reclassified as Securities pledged under securities lending, at fair value. The Company maintains legal control over the securities it lends, retains the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receives a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities. Collateral received is required at a rate of 102 % or greater of the fair value of the loaned securities including accrued investment income and is monitored and maintained by the lending agent. Such collateral is reflected as Collateral received under securities lending, at fair value. The Companys investment portfolio includes certain funds that, due to their ownership structure, are accounted for by the Company using the equity method. In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are ARCH CAPITAL 97 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS subsequently adjusted based on the Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the fair value of the underlying securities in the funds). Such investments are generally recorded on a one to three month lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. Changes in the carrying value of such investments are recorded in net income as Equity in net income (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method. As such, fluctuations in the carrying value of the investments accounted for using the equity method may increase the volatility of the Companys reported results of operations. The Companys investment portfolio includes equity securities that are accounted for at fair value. Such holdings primarily include publicly traded common stocks. Dividend income on equities is reflected in net investment income. Changes in fair value on equity securities are included in Net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of income. The Company elected to carry certain fixed maturity securities, equity securities and other investments at fair value under the fair value option afforded by accounting guidance regarding the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities. The fair value for certain of the Companys other investments are determined using net asset values (NAVs) as advised by external fund managers. The NAV is based on the fund managers valuation of the underlying holdings in accordance with the funds governing documents. Changes in fair value of investments accounted for using the fair value option are included in Net realized gains (losses). The primary reasons for electing the fair value option were to address simplification and cost-benefit considerations. The Company invests in limited partner interests and shares of limited liability companies. Such amounts are included in investments accounted for using the equity method, other investments available for sale and investments accounted for using the fair value option. These investments can often have characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE). A VIE refers to entities that have characteristics such as (i) insufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or (ii) instances where the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, it is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest as a result of having both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. At inception of the VIE as well as on an ongoing basis, the Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary based on an analysis of the Companys level of involvement in the VIE, the contractual terms, and the overall structure of the VIE. The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment. The Company performs quarterly reviews of its investments to determine whether declines in fair value below the cost basis are considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable accounting guidance regarding the recognition and presentation of OTTI. The process of determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires judgment and involves analyzing many factors. These factors include (i) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer, (ii) the time period in which there was a significant decline in value, (iii) the significance of the decline and (iv) the analysis of specific credit events. When there are credit-related losses associated with debt securities for which the Company does not have an intent to sell and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, the amount of the OTTI related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings and the amount of the OTTI related to other factors ( e.g. , interest rates, market conditions, etc.) is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The amount of the credit loss of an impaired debt security is the difference between the amortized cost and the greater of (i) the present value of expected future cash flows and (ii) the fair value of the security. In instances where no credit loss exists but it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery, the decline in fair value below amortized cost is recognized as an OTTI in earnings. In periods after the recognition of an OTTI on debt securities, the Company accounts for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which OTTI were recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted or amortized into net investment income. See note 8, Investment Information for additional information. Net investment income includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts and is net of investment management and custody fees. Anticipated prepayments and expected maturities are used in applying the interest method for certain investments such as mortgage and other asset-backed securities. When actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in such securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the security. Such adjustments, if any, are included in net investment income when determined. ARCH CAPITAL 98 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment gains or losses realized on the sale of investments, except for certain fund investments, are determined on a first-in, first-out basis and are reflected in net income. Investment gains or losses realized on the sale of certain fund investments are determined on an average cost basis. Unrealized appreciation or decline in the value of available for sale securities, which are carried at fair value, is excluded from net income and recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax. (i) Derivative Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, including embedded derivative instruments, at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company employs the use of derivative instruments within its operations to mitigate risks arising from assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies as well as part of its overall investment strategy. For such instruments, changes in assets and liabilities measured at fair value are recorded as Net realized gains in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, the Companys derivative instruments include amounts related to underwriting activities where an insurance or reinsurance contract meets the accounting definition of a derivative instrument. For such contracts, changes in fair value are reflected in Other underwriting income in the consolidated statements of income as the underlying contract originates from the Companys underwriting operations. For the periods ended 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the Company did not designate any derivative instruments as hedges under the relevant accounting guidance. See note 10, Derivative Instruments for additional information. (j) Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Insurance and Reinsurance. The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses consists of estimates of unpaid reported losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimates for losses incurred but not reported. The reserve for unpaid reported losses and loss adjustment expenses, established by management based on reports from ceding companies and claims from insureds, excludes estimates of amounts related to losses under high deductible policies, and represents the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. Such reserves are supplemented by managements estimates of reserves for losses incurred for which reports or claims have not been received. The Companys reserves are based on a combination of reserving methods, incorporating both Company and industry loss development patterns. The Company selects the initial expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios based on information derived by its underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business, supplemented by industry data where appropriate. Such ratios consider, among other things, rate changes and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in income in the period in which they are determined. As actual loss information has been reported, the Company has developed its own loss experience and its reserving methods include other actuarial techniques. Over time, such techniques have been given further weight in its reserving process based on the continuing maturation of the Companys reserves. Inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claims severity and frequency and other factors which may vary significantly as claims are settled. Accordingly, ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded on an undiscounted basis, except for excess workers compensation and employers liability business written by the Companys insurance operations. Mortgage. The reserves for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are the estimated claim settlement costs on notices of delinquency that have been received by the Company, as well as loan delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by the lenders. Consistent with primary mortgage insurance industry accounting practice, the Company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently delinquent (defined as two consecutive missed payments). The Company establishes loss reserves on a case-by-case basis when insured loans are reported delinquent using estimated claim rates and average claim sizes for each cohort, net of any salvage recoverable. The Company also reserves for delinquencies that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company prior to the close of an accounting period. To determine this reserve, the Company estimates the number of delinquencies not yet reported using historical information regarding late reported delinquencies and applies estimated claim rates and claim sizes for the estimated delinquencies not yet reported. The establishment of reserves across the Companys segments is an inherently uncertain process, are necessarily based on estimates, and the ultimate net cost may vary from such estimates. The methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are reviewed and updated using the most current information available. Any resulting adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in current operations. (k) Contractholder Receivables and Payables and Collateral Held for Insured Obligations Certain insurance policies written by the Companys insurance operations feature large deductibles, primarily in its construction and national accounts lines of business. Under such contracts, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant ARCH CAPITAL 99 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively. In the event that the Company is unable to collect from the policyholder, the Company would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Collateral, primarily in the form of letters of credit, cash and trusts, is obtained from the policyholder to mitigate the Companys credit risk. In the instances where the Company receives collateral in the form of cash, the Company reflects it in Collateral held for insured obligations. (l) Foreign Exchange Assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated at the prevailing exchange rates at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The net effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax. Monetary assets and liabilities, such as premiums receivable and the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in net income. Accounts that are classified as non-monetary, such as deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserves, are not revalued. In the case of foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities which are classified as available for sale, the change in exchange rates between the local currency in which the investments are denominated and the Companys functional currency at each balance sheet date is included in unrealized appreciation or decline in value of securities, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax. (m) Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The Company considers future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its deferred income tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, if the Company subsequently assesses that the valuation allowance is no longer needed, a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination is made. See note 14, Income Taxes for additional information. The Company recognizes a tax benefit where it concludes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in the Companys judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. (n) Share-Based Payment Arrangements The Company applies a fair value based measurement method in accounting for its share-based payment arrangements with eligible employees and directors. Compensation expense is estimated based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and is recognized in net income over the requisite service period with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity. No value is attributed to awards that employees forfeit because they fail to satisfy vesting conditions. The Companys (i) time-based awards generally vest over a three year period with one-third vesting on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and (ii) performance-based awards cliff vest after each three year performance period based on achievement of the specified performance criteria. The share-based compensation expense associated with awards that have graded vesting features and vest based on service conditions only is calculated on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense recognized in connection with performance awards is based on the achievement of the specified performance and service conditions. The final measure of compensation expense recognized over the requisite service period reflects the final performance outcome. During the recognition period compensation expense is accrued based on the performance condition that is probable of achievement. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees where no service is required for the employee to retain the award, the grant date fair value is immediately recognized as compensation expense at the grant date because the employee is able to retain the award without continuing to provide service. For employees near retirement eligibility, attribution of compensation cost is over the period from the grant date to the retirement eligibility date. These charges had no impact on the Companys cash flows or total shareholders equity. See note 21, Share-Based Compensation for information relating to the Companys share-based payment awards. (o) Guaranty Fund and Other Related Assessments Liabilities for guaranty fund and other related assessments in the Companys insurance and reinsurance operations are accrued when the Company receives notice that an amount is ARCH CAPITAL 100 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS payable, or earlier if a reasonable estimate of the assessment can be made. (p) Treasury Shares Treasury shares are common shares purchased by the Company and not subsequently canceled. These shares are recorded at cost and result in a reduction of the Companys shareholders equity in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. (q) Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is assigned to the applicable reporting unit at acquisition. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. Impairment tests may be performed more frequently if the facts and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. In performing impairment tests, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, more than a 50% probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in the accounting guidance. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as insurance licenses are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets and liabilities include the value of acquired insurance and reinsurance contracts, which are estimated based on the present value of future expected cash flows and amortized in proportion to the estimated profits expected to be realized. Other finite-lived intangible assets or liabilities, including favorable or unfavorable contracts, are amortized over their useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets and liabilities are periodically reviewed for indicators of impairment. An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value. If goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, such assets are written down to their fair values with the related expense recorded in the Companys results of operations. (r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which provides a new comprehensive model for lease accounting. Topic 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company adopted the modified retrospective approach of this standard, that resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset of $ 147.9 million as part of other assets and a lease liability of $ 163.6 million as part of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The Company de-recognized the liability for deferred rent that was required under the previous guidance. In addition, the Company adopted ASU 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements (Topic 842), which provides an additional (optional) transition method to adopt the new lease standard. The Company adopted the alternative transition method and elected to utilize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of the retained earnings for the year of adoption. As such, the Companys reporting for the comparative periods prior to the adoption continue to be presented in the financial statements in accordance with previous lease accounting guidance. The Company also adopted the practical expedients as a package which allows the Company to not reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases and (4) to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. In addition to electing the practical expedients as a package, the Company elected to include hindsight to determine the lease term of existing leases, and made an accounting policy election to not apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases (lease term of less than twelve months). The cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was zero. The adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or liquidity. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which was issued in June 2018 to simplify the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services. Under this ASU, most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. This guidance and the adoption of this provision did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which was issued in February 2018 to allow the reclassification of the stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Cuts Act). Current guidance requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax balances to be reported in income from continuing operations in the accounting period that includes the period of enactment, even if the related income tax effects were originally charged or credited directly to AOCI. The amount of the reclassification would include the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amounts and related valuation allowances, if any, at the date of the enactment of the Tax Cuts Act related to items in AOCI. ARCH CAPITAL 101 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Tax Cuts Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The Company adopted ASU 2017-08 Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which was issued in March 2017. This ASU shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium and requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. However, the new guidance does not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount whose discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of the guidance requires a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), was issued in June 2016. The ASU changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that arent measured at fair value through net income. The ASU requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The ASU is effective for the 2020 first quarter, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis for the majority of the provisions with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company expects the new standard to have an impact on certain type of investment securities, reinsurance recoverables and contractholder receivables. The Company will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2020 by applying the modified retrospective approach. The Company anticipates recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, which is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, was issued in August, 2018. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement as part of the disclosure framework project with the objective to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. The amendments in this update allow for removal of (1) the amount and reasons for transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for transfers between levels; and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) , was issued in the 2018 third quarter. This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing certain implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The guidance provides flexibility in adoption, allowing for either retrospective adjustment or prospective adjustment for all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 4 . Segment Information The Company classifies its businesses into three underwriting segments  insurance, reinsurance and mortgage  and two other operating segments  other and corporate (non-underwriting). The Company determined its reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results. The Companys insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to the Companys chief operating decision makers, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Arch Capital and the Chief Financial Officer of Arch Capital. The chief operating decision makers do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for its three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. The Company does not manage its assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and ARCH CAPITAL 102 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

Property catastrophe: provides protection for most catastrophic losses that are covered in the underlying policies written by reinsureds, including hurricane, earthquake, flood, tornado, hail and fire, and coverage for other perils on a case-by-case basis. Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expense from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the retention specified in the contract.  Property excluding property catastrophe: provides coverage for both personal lines and commercial property exposures and principally covers buildings, structures, equipment and contents. The primary perils in this business include fire, explosion, collapse, riot, vandalism, wind, tornado, flood and earthquake. Business is assumed on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.

(2) During the 2019 first quarter and 2018 second quarter, a subsidiary of the Company entered into two separate retroactive reinsurance transactions with third party reinsurers to reinsure run-off liabilities associated with certain U.S. insurance exposures. 2019 Prior Year Reserve Development During 2019, the Company recorded estimated net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $ 163.6 million , which consisted of net favorable development of $ 15.8 million from the insurance segment, $ 46.4 million from the reinsurance segment and $ 125.2 million from the mortgage segment, partially offset by $ 23.8 million of net adverse development from the other segment. The insurance segments net favorable development of $ 15.8 million , or 7.0 points of net earned premium, consisted of $ 54.9 million of net favorable development from short-tailed lines and $ 39.1 million of net adverse development from medium-tailed and long-tailed lines. Net favorable development in short-tailed lines primarily resulted from lenders products and property (including special risk other than marine) reserves across all accident years, (i.e., the year in which a loss occurred) partially offset by net adverse development in travel business, primarily from the 2018 accident year. Net adverse development in medium-tailed and long-tailed lines of $39.1 million was primarily due to net adverse development of $ 33.6 million in contract binding business, primarily from the 2013 to 2017 accident years, and $ 30.1 million in programs, primarily from the 2014 and 2018 accident years. Such amounts were partially offset by net favorable development of $ 19.3 million in professional liability business, primarily from the 2013 to 2016 accident years, and $ 15.8 million in surety business, primarily from the 2014 to 2016 accident years. The reinsurance segments net favorable development of $ 46.4 million , or 3.2 points of net earned premium, consisted of $ 70.5 million of net favorable development from short-tailed lines and $ 16.0 million of net favorable development from medium-tailed lines, partially offset by $ 40.1 million of net adverse development from long-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $ 33.7 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, primarily from the 2017 and 2018 underwriting years (i.e., losses attributable to contracts having an inception or renewal date within the given twelve-month period) and $ 40.8 million in other specialty, primarily from 2016 to 2018 ARCH CAPITAL 110 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

Net favorable development of $ 16.0 million in medium-tailed lines included reductions in marine and aviation reserves, primarily from the 2011 to 2017 underwriting years. Net adverse development in long-tailed lines of $ 40.1 million was primarily due to net adverse development of $ 44.5 million in casualty business, primarily from the 2013 to 2018 underwriting years. The mortgage segments net favorable development of $ 125.2 million , or 9.2 points of net earned premium, included $ 117.1 million of favorable development on U.S. primary mortgage business. Such development was primarily driven by continued lower than expected claim rates on first lien business and subrogation recoveries on second lien business. 2018 Prior Year Reserve Development During 2018, the Company recorded estimated net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $ 272.7 million , which consisted of $ 24.4 million from the insurance segment, $ 138.5 million from the reinsurance segment, $ 107.6 million from the mortgage segment and $ 2.2 million from the other segment. The insurance segments net favorable development of $ 24.4 million , or 1.1 points of net earned premium, consisted of $ 48.4 million of net favorable development from short-tailed lines and $ 26.3 million of net favorable development from long-tailed lines, partially offset by $ 50.3 million of net adverse development from medium-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines predominantly consisted of $ 50.1 million of net favorable development in property lines, primarily from the 2010 to 2017 accident years, partially offset by $ 5.0 million of adverse development on travel, accident and health business from the 2013 to 2017 accident years. Net favorable development in long-tailed lines of $ 26.3 million included $ 19.7 million of net favorable development on executive assurance business, primarily from the 2015 accident year, and $ 1.4 million of net favorable development in casualty business, primarily from the 2009 to 2015 accident years. Net adverse development in medium tailed lines of $ 50.3 million was primarily due to net adverse development in contract binding business for accident years 2013 to 2017. The reinsurance segments net favorable development of $ 138.5 million , or 11.0 points of net earned premium, consisted of $ 110.4 million from short-tailed lines and $ 28.1 million from medium-tailed and long-tailed lines. Favorable development in short-tailed lines included $ 80.8 million from property catastrophe and property other than property catastrophe reserves, primarily from the 2008 to 2017 underwriting years. The net reduction of loss estimates for the reinsurance segments short-tailed lines primarily resulted from varying levels of reported and paid claims activity than previously anticipated which led to decreases in certain loss ratio selections during 2018. Net favorable development of $ 28.1 million in medium-tailed and long-tailed lines included reductions in casualty reserves of $ 12.5 million , primarily from the 2002 to 2010 underwriting years, and in marine and aviation reserves of $ 15.6 million , spread across most underwriting years. The mortgage segments net favorable development of $ 107.6 million , or 9.1 points of net earned premium, included $ 103.4 million of favorable development on U.S. primary mortgage business. Such development was primarily driven by continued lower than expected claim rates on first lien business and subrogation recoveries on second lien business. 2017 Prior Year Reserve Development During 2017, the Company recorded estimated net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $ 238.0 million , which consisted of $ 8.6 million from the insurance segment, $ 165.4 million from the reinsurance segment, and $ 95.0 million from the mortgage segment, less adverse development of $ 31.0 million from the other segment.

Short Duration Contracts The Companys reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily relate to short-duration contracts with various characteristics ( e.g. , type of coverage, geography, claims duration). The Company considered such information in determining the level of disaggregation for disclosures related to its short-duration contracts, as detailed in the table below: Reportable segment Level of disaggregation Included lines of business Insurance Property energy, marine and aviation Property energy, marine and aviation Third party occurrence business Excess and surplus casualty (excluding contract binding); construction and national accounts; and other (including alternative market risks, excess workers compensation and employers liability insurance coverages) Third party claims-made business Professional lines Multi-line and other specialty Programs; contract binding (part of excess and surplus casualty); travel, accident and health; lenders products; and other (c ontract and commercial surety coverages) Reinsurance Casualty Casualty Property catastrophe Property catastrophe Property excluding property catastrophe Property excluding property catastrophe Marine and aviation Marine and aviation Other specialty Other specialty Mortgage Direct mortgage insurance in the U.S. Mortgage insurance on U.S. primary exposures The Company determined the following to be insignificant for disclosure purposes: (i) amounts included in the other segment ( i.e. , Watford ) as described in note 11, Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests ; (ii) certain mortgage business, including non-U.S. primary business, second lien and student loan exposures, global mortgage reinsurance and participation in various GSE credit risk-sharing products; (iii) certain reinsurance business, including casualty clash and non-traditional lines, and (iv) amounts associated with the Barbican acquisition. Such amounts are included as reconciling items. The Company is required to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses (Loss Reserves) that arise from the business the Company underwrites. Loss Reserves for the insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments represent estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. Loss Reserves do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences. Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial. Insurance Segment Loss Reserves for the insurance segment are comprised of estimated amounts for (1) reported losses (case reserves) and (2) incurred but not reported losses (IBNR reserves). Generally, claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. The Company also contracts with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who, in certain cases, have limited authority to establish case reserves. The work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel. Loss Reserves are also established to provide for loss adjustment expenses and represent the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. Periodically, adjustments to the case reserves may be made as additional information is reported or payments are made. IBNR reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving. Actuaries estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Like case reserves, IBNR reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement ARCH CAPITAL 112 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. In forecasting ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to any line of business, past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource, developed through both industry and company experience, but cannot be relied upon in isolation. Uncertainties in estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are magnified by the length of the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled. This time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim-tail. During this period additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years, as well as about actual claims and trends, may become known and, as a result, may lead to adjustments of the related Loss Reserves. If the Company determines that an adjustment is appropriate, the adjustment is recorded in the accounting period in which such determination is made. Accordingly, should Loss Reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established, future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted respectively. The Company authorizes managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write program business on the Companys behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities. This delegated authority process introduces additional complexity to the actuarial determination of unpaid future losses and loss adjustment expenses. In order to monitor adherence to the underwriting guidelines given to such parties, the Company periodically performs underwriting and claims due diligence reviews. In determining ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses, the cost to indemnify claimants, provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered. These claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time, such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions, inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property, inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits, as well as by the particular, unique facts that pertain to each claim. As a result, the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future. The factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations. Changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and/or development patterns to vary from the past. A key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses, and resulting IBNR reserves, is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and adjust for them so that the future can be projected more reliably. Because of the factors previously discussed, this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain. Although Loss Reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analyses, the Companys insurance segment applies several generally accepted actuarial methods, as discussed below, on a quarterly basis to evaluate the Loss Reserves, in addition to the expected loss method, in particular for Loss Reserves from more mature accident years (the year in which a loss occurred). Each quarter, as part of the reserving process, the segments actuaries reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for the projection of liabilities. If actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information, an adjustment to Loss Reserves may be supported. The Company places more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of Loss Reserves are made. These methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:  Expected loss methods - these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums. Expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios are typically developed based upon the information derived by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business, supplemented by industry data available from organizations, such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms, where appropriate. These ratios consider, among other things, rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market. Expected loss methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses in the early years of long-tailed lines of business, when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available, and is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists for a company.  Historical incurred loss development methods - these methods assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future. These methods use incurred losses ( i.e. , the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves) over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses. Historical incurred loss development methods may be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims. However, historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time. Therefore, when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established, using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses may be less reliable than other methods.  Historical paid loss development methods - these methods, like historical incurred loss development methods, assume ARCH CAPITAL 113 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant. These methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses and necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past, such as inflation or the effects of litigation, will remain constant in the future. Because historical paid loss development methods do not use incurred losses to estimate ultimate losses, they may be more reliable than the other methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how incurred losses are established by a companys claims adjusters. However, historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged (meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses) than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts. In addition, and for similar reasons, historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past.  Adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods - these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation, the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves. Adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change, provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes. As such, these methods utilize more judgment than historical paid and incurred loss development methods.  Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) paid and incurred loss methods - these methods utilize actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses. The B-F paid and incurred loss methods are useful when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses.  Frequency-Severity methods - These methods utilize actual paid and incurred claim experience, but break the data down into its component pieces: claim counts, often expressed as a ratio to exposure or premium (frequency), and average claim size (severity). The component pieces are projected to an ultimate level and multiplied together to result in an estimate of ultimate loss. These methods are especially useful when the severity of claims can be confined to a relatively stable range of estimated ultimate average claim value.  Additional analyses - other methodologies are often used in the reserving process for specific types of claims or events, such as catastrophic or other specific major events. These include vendor catastrophe models, which are typically used in the estimation of Loss Reserves at the early stage of known catastrophic events before information has been reported to an insurer or reinsurer. In the initial reserving process for short-tail insurance lines (consisting of property, energy, marine and aviation and other exposures including travel, accident and health and lenders products), the Company relies on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above. For catastrophe-exposed business, the reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models for known events and a heavy reliance on analysis of individual catastrophic events and management judgment. The development of losses on short-tail business can be unstable, especially for policies characterized by high severity, low frequency losses. As time passes, for a given accident year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and eventually to the historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in their reserving process, including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable, catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and underwriters judgment as to potential loss exposures can be relied on. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for short-tail business have varied over time due to changes in pricing, reinsurance structure, estimates of catastrophe losses, policy changes (such as attachment points, class and limits) and geographical distribution. As losses in short-tail lines are reported relatively quickly, expected loss ratios are selected for the current accident year based upon actual attritional loss ratios for earlier accident years, adjusted for rate changes, inflation, changes in reinsurance programs and expected attritional losses based on modeling. Furthermore, ultimate losses for short-tail business are known in a reasonably short period of time. In the initial reserving process for medium-tail and long-tail insurance lines ( consisting of third party occurrence business, third party claims made business, and other exposures including surety, programs and contract binding exposures), the Company primarily relies on the expected loss method. The development of the Companys medium-tail and long-tail business may be unstable, especially if there are high severity major events, as a portion of the Companys casualty business is in high excess layers. As time passes, for a given accident year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in reserving for medium-tail and long-tail lines, including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the policy is entered into, that the loss development patterns, which are based on a ARCH CAPITAL 114 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS combination of company and industry loss development patterns and adjusted to reflect differences in the insurance segments mix of business, are reasonable and that claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are assumed to be the best estimate of exposure to the known claims on those events. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for medium-tail and long-tail business for recent accident years have varied over time, in some cases significantly, from earlier accident years. As the credibility of historical experience for earlier accident years increases, the experience from these accident years will be given a greater weighting in the actuarial analysis to determine future accident year expected loss ratios, adjusted for changes in pricing, loss trends, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure. In 2019 and 2018, the Company entered into two separate loss portfolio transfers and adverse development cover reinsurance agreements accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. These agreements transfer Loss Reserves and future favorable or adverse development on certain runoff programs and other exposures within multi-line and other specialty business, and certain third party occurrence business (the Covered Lines). As incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for the Covered Lines are ceded to the reinsurer, the Company is not exposed to changes in the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from the Covered Lines.

The Company receives reports of claims notices from ceding companies and records case reserves based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company. Case reserves may be supplemented by ACRs, which may be estimated by the Companys claims personnel ahead of official notification from the ceding company, or when judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company. In certain instances, the Company establishes ACRs even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event. In addition, specific claim information reported by ceding companies or obtained through claim audits can alert the Company to emerging trends such as changing legal interpretations of coverage and liability, claims from unexpected sources or classes of business, and significant changes in the frequency or severity of individual claims. Such information is often used in the process of estimating IBNR reserves. IBNR reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported at the balance sheet date as well as to adjust for any projected variance in case reserving. Actuaries estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information. Like case reserves, IBNR reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The process of estimating Loss Reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. The estimation of Loss Reserves for the reinsurance segment is subject to the same risk factors as the estimation of Loss Reserves for the insurance segment. In addition, the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for reinsurers, due primarily to the following factors: (1) the claim-tail for reinsurers is generally longer because claims are first reported to the ceding company and then to the reinsurer through one or more intermediaries, (2) the reliance on premium estimates, where reports have not been received from the ceding ARCH CAPITAL 117 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS company, in the reserving process, (3) the potential for writing a number of reinsurance contracts with different ceding companies with the same exposure to a single loss event, (4) the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance contracts, (5) the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and (6) the differing reserving practices among ceding companies. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future.As with the insurance segment, the process of estimating Loss Reserves for the reinsurance segment involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. As discussed above, such uncertainty is greater for reinsurers compared to insurers. As a result, our reinsurance operations obtain information from numerous sources to assist in the process. Pricing actuaries from the reinsurance segment devote considerable effort to understanding and analyzing a ceding companys operations and loss history during the underwriting of the business, using a combination of ceding company and industry statistics. Such statistics normally include historical premium and loss data by class of business, individual claim information for larger claims, distributions of insurance limits provided, loss reporting and payment patterns, and rate change history. This analysis is used to project expected loss ratios for each treaty during the upcoming contract period. As mentioned above, there can be a considerable time lag from the time a claim is reported to a ceding company to the time it is reported to the reinsurer. The lag can be several years in some cases and may be attributed to a number of reasons, including the time it takes to investigate a claim, delays associated with the litigation process, the deterioration in a claimants physical condition many years after an accident occurs, the case reserving approach of the ceding company, etc. In the reserving process, the Company assumes that such lags are predictable, on average, over time and therefore the lags are contemplated in the loss reporting patterns used in their actuarial methods. This means that the reinsurance segment must rely on estimates for a longer period of time than does an insurance company. Backlogs in the recording of assumed reinsurance can also complicate the accuracy of loss reserve estimation. As of December 31, 2019 there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information at our reinsurance operations. The reinsurance segment relies heavily on information reported by ceding companies, as discussed above. In order to determine the accuracy and completeness of such information, underwriters, actuaries, and claims personnel often perform audits of ceding companies and regularly review information received from ceding companies for unusual or unexpected results. Material findings are usually discussed with the ceding companies. The Company sometimes encounters situations where they determine that a claim presentation from a ceding company is not in accordance with contract terms. In these situations, the Company attempts to resolve the dispute with the ceding company. Most situations are resolved amicably and without the need for litigation or arbitration. However, in the infrequent situations where a resolution is not possible, the Company will vigorously defend its position in such disputes. Although Loss Reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analysis, the Company applies several generally accepted actuarial methods, as discussed above, on a quarterly basis to evaluate its Loss Reserves in addition to the expected loss method, in particular for reserves from more mature underwriting years (the year in which business is underwritten). Each quarter, as part of the reserving process, the Companys actuaries reaffirm that the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a sound basis for projection of liabilities. If actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information, an adjustment to Loss Reserves may be supported. Estimated Loss Reserves for more mature underwriting years are now based more on actual loss activity and historical patterns than on the initial assumptions based on pricing indications. More recent underwriting years rely more heavily on internal pricing assumptions. The Company places more or less reliance on a particular actuarial method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the estimates of Loss Reserves are made. In the initial reserving process for short-tail reinsurance lines (consisting of property excluding property catastrophe and property catastrophe exposures), the Company relies on a combination of the reserving methods discussed above. For known catastrophic events, the reserving process also includes the usage of catastrophe models and a heavy reliance on analysis which includes ceding company inquiries and management judgment. The development of property losses may be unstable, especially where there is high catastrophic exposure, may be characterized by high severity, low frequency losses for excess and catastrophe-exposed business and may be highly correlated across contracts. As time passes, for a given underwriting year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. The Company makes a number of key assumptions in reserving for short-tail lines, including that historical paid and reported development patterns are stable, catastrophe models provide useful information about our exposure to catastrophic events that have occurred and our underwriters judgment and guidance received from ceding companies as to potential loss exposures may be relied on. The expected loss ratios used in the initial reserving process for property exposures have varied over time due to changes in pricing, reinsurance structure, estimates of catastrophe losses, terms and conditions and geographical distribution. As losses in property lines are reported relatively ARCH CAPITAL 118 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS quickly, expected loss ratios are selected for the current underwriting year incorporating the experience for earlier underwriting years, adjusted for rate changes, inflation, changes in reinsurance programs, expectations about present and future market conditions and expected attritional losses based on modeling. Due to the short-tail nature of property business, reported loss experience emerges quickly and ultimate losses are known in a reasonably short period of time. In the initial reserving process for medium-tail and long-tail reinsurance lines (consisting of casualty, other specialty, marine and aviation and other exposures), the Company primarily relies on the expected loss method. The development of medium-tail and long-tail business may be unstable, especially if there are high severity major events, with business written on an excess of loss basis typically having a longer tail than business written on a pro rata basis. As time passes, for a given underwriting year, additional weight is given to the paid and incurred B-F loss development methods and eventually to the historical paid and incurred loss development methods in the reserving process. Our reinsurance operations make a number of key assumptions in reserving for medium-tail and long-tail lines, including that the pricing loss ratio is the best estimate of the ultimate loss ratio at the time the contract is entered into, historical paid and reported development patterns are stable and claims personnel and underwriters analyses of our exposure to major events are our best estimate of our exposure to the known claims on those events. The expected loss ratios used in our reinsurance operations initial reserving process for medium-tail and long-tail contracts have varied over time due to changes in pricing, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure. As the credibility of historical experience for earlier underwriting years increases, the experience from these underwriting years is used in the actuarial analysis to determine future underwriting year expected loss ratios, adjusted for changes in pricing, loss trends, terms and conditions and reinsurance structure.

For direct mortgage insurance business, the Company establishes case reserves for loans that have been reported as delinquent by loan servicers as well as those that are delinquent but not reported (IBNR reserves). The Companys U.S. mortgage insurance operations also reserve for the expenses of adjusting claims related to these delinquencies. The trigger that creates a case reserve estimate is that an insured loan is reported to us as being two payments in arrears. The actuarial reviews and documentation created in the reserving process are completed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards. The selected assumptions reflect the actuarys judgment based on historical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements. Because the reserving process requires the Company to forecast future conditions, it is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgment and estimation. The use of different estimates would result in the establishment of different reserve levels. Additionally, changes in estimates are likely to occur from period to period as economic conditions change and the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the estimates used. Major risk factors include (but are not limited to) changes in home prices and borrower equity, which can limit the borrowers ability to sell the property and satisfy the outstanding loan balance, and changes in unemployment, which can affect the borrowers income and ability to make mortgage payments. The lead methodology used by the Company is a frequency-severity method based on the inventory of pending delinquencies. Each month the loan servicers report the delinquency status of each insured loan. Using the frequency-severity method allows the Company to take advantage of its knowledge of the number of delinquent loans and the coverage provided (risk size) on those loans by directly relating the reserves to these amounts. The delinquencies are grouped into homogeneous cohorts for analysis, reflecting product type and age of delinquency. A claim rate is then developed for each cohort which represents the frequency with which the delinquencies become claims. The claim frequency rates are based on an analysis of the patterns of emerging cure counts and claim counts, the foreclosure status of the pending delinquencies, the product and geographical mix of the delinquencies and our view of future economic and claim conditions, which include trends in home prices and unemployment. Claim rates can vary materially by age of delinquency, depending on the mix of delinquencies and economic conditions. Claim size severity estimates are determined by examining the risk sizes on the delinquent loans and estimating the portion of risk that will be paid, as well as any expenses. This is done based on a review of historical development patterns, an assessment of economic conditions and the level of equity the borrowers may have in their homes, as well as considering economic conditions and loss mitigation opportunities. Mortgage insurance is generally not subject to large claim sizes, as with some other lines of insurance. A claim size over $ 250,000 is rare, and this helps reduce the volatility of claim size estimates. The claim rate and claim size assumptions generate case reserves for the population of reported delinquencies. The reserve for unreported delinquencies (included in IBNR reserves) is estimated by looking at historical patterns of reporting. Claim rates and claim sizes can then be assigned to estimated unreported delinquencies using assumptions made in the establishment of case reserves. Mortgage insurance Loss Reserves are short-tail, in the sense that the vast majority of delinquencies are resolved within two years of being reported. While reserves are initially analyzed by reserve cohort, as described above, they are also rolled up by underwriting year to ensure that reserve assumptions are consistent with the performance of the underwriting year. The accuracy of prior reserve assumptions is also checked in hindsight to determine if adjustments to the assumptions are needed. Loss Reserves for the Companys mortgage reinsurance business and GSE credit-risk sharing transactions are comprised of case reserves and IBNR reserves. The Companys ARCH CAPITAL 122 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS mortgage reinsurance operations receive reports of delinquent loans and claims notices from ceding companies and record case reserves based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company. In addition, specific claim and delinquency information reported by ceding companies is used in the process of estimating IBNR reserves. The tables below include the acquired business of United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) (including United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company), across all periods presented. Due to the length of time for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding prior to payment and the Companys formation of the mortgage segment in 2014, the Company determined that eight accident years was sufficient for its current disclosures.

For all business assumed by Watford, the Company acts as reinsurance underwriting manager, provides actuarial and risk management services and recommends a level of Loss Reserves to Watford. The Company does not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford, and the Companys financial exposure to Watford is limited to its investment in Watfords common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. The estimation of Loss Reserves for Watford is subject to the same risk factors as the estimation of Loss Reserves for the Companys insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments as described earlier. Watford performs its own reserve reviews and sets its reserves independently. As noted previously, the Company determined that amounts in the other segment are insignificant for the purposes of these footnote disclosures. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company did not make any significant changes in its methodologies or assumptions as described above (a) to determine the presented amounts of IBNR reserves, (b) for expected development on case reserves. The Company measures claim frequency information on an individual claim count basis. Claim counts are provided for the insurance and mortgage segments, where reliable information is available. For insurance business, any claim which is reported to the Company is included in the count, even if it is ARCH CAPITAL 123 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS subsequently settled without liability to the Company. The Company does not include claim count information for losses from U.S. insurance pool business where individual loss information is unavailable and impracticable to obtain. For mortgage business, only delinquencies which subsequently become claims are included in the claim count. For reinsurance business, claim counts are not provided. A significant amount of the Companys reinsurance business is written on a proportional basis, for which individual loss information is typically unavailable and impracticable to obtain. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company did not make any significant changes in its methodologies or assumptions as described above to calculate the cumulative claim frequency.

Reinsurance In the normal course of business, the Companys insurance subsidiaries cede a portion of their premium through pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance agreements on a treaty or facultative basis. The Companys reinsurance subsidiaries participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain pro rata treaties. Such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties, including the reinsurers, such as the Companys reinsurance subsidiaries, and the ceding company. In addition, the Companys reinsurance subsidiaries may purchase retrocessional coverage as part of their risk management program. The Companys mortgage subsidiaries cede a portion of their premium through quota share arrangements and enter into various aggregate excess of loss mortgage reinsurance agreements with various special purpose reinsurance companies. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, the Companys insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. The effects of reinsurance on the Companys written and earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses with unaffiliated reinsurers were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Premiums Written Direct $ 5,681,523 $ 4,838,902 $ 4,447,457 Assumed 2,457,437 2,122,102 1,920,968 Ceded ( 2,099,893 ) ( 1,614,257 ) ( 1,407,052 ) Net $ 6,039,067 $ 5,346,747 $ 4,961,373 Premiums Earned Direct $ 5,447,829 $ 4,799,842 $ 4,379,131 Assumed 2,337,950 1,988,038 1,856,573 Ceded ( 1,999,281 ) ( 1,555,905 ) ( 1,391,172 ) Net $ 5,786,498 $ 5,231,975 $ 4,844,532 Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Direct $ 2,953,072 $ 2,472,133 $ 2,568,327 Assumed 1,602,528 1,307,317 1,442,077 Ceded ( 1,422,148 ) ( 889,344 ) ( 1,042,958 ) Net $ 3,133,452 $ 2,890,106 $ 2,967,446 Reinsurance Recoverables The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. Although the Company has not experienced any material credit losses to date, an inability of its reinsurers or retrocessionaires to meet their obligations to it over the relevant exposure periods for any reason could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The following table summarizes the Companys reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses (not including ceded unearned premiums) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 : December 31, 2019 2018 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 4,346,816 $ 2,919,372 % due from carriers with A.M.

Securities Lending Agreements The Company enters into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income whereby it loans certain of its securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms, for short periods of time through a lending agent. The Company maintains legal control over the securities it lends, retains the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receives a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities. An indemnification agreement with the lending agent protects the Company in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan to the Company. The Company receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral primarily consists of short-term investments. At December 31, 2019 , the fair value of the cash collateral received on securities lending was $ 81.2 million and the fair value of security collateral received was $ 307.2 million . At December 31, 2018 , the fair value of the cash collateral received on securities lending was $ 19.0 million and the fair value of security collateral received was $ 255.1 million .

Such investments are generally recorded on a one to three month lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. A summary of financial information for the Companys investment funds accounted for using the equity method is as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Invested assets $ 26,383,370 $ 28,299,386 Total assets 28,039,181 29,833,681 Total liabilities 3,595,695 3,406,612 Net assets $ 24,443,486 $ 26,427,069 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 164,669 $ 4,565,354 $ 3,867,874 Total expenses 528,762 1,135,602 782,773 Net income (loss) $ ( 364,093 ) $ 3,429,752 $ 3,085,101 Certain of the Companys other investments and investments accounted for using the equity method are in investment funds for which the Company has the option to redeem at agreed upon values as described in each investment funds subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investments in investment funds may be redeemed daily, monthly, quarterly or on other terms. Two common redemption restrictions which may impact the Companys ability to redeem these investment funds are gates and lockups. A gate is a suspension of redemptions which may be implemented by the general partner or investment manager of the fund in order to defer, in whole or in part, the redemption request in the event the aggregate amount of redemption requests exceeds a predetermined percentage of the investment fund's net assets which may otherwise hinder the general partner or investment manager's ability to liquidate holdings in an orderly fashion in order to generate the cash necessary to fund extraordinarily large redemption payouts. A lockup period is the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to hold the security before having the ability to redeem. If the investment funds are eligible to be redeemed, the time to redeem such fund can take weeks or months following the notification.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Limited Partnership Interests In the normal course of its activities, the Company invests in limited partnerships as part of its overall investment strategy. Such amounts are included in investments accounted for using the equity method and investments accounted for using the fair value option. The Company determined that these limited partnership interests represented variable interests in the funds because the general partner did not have a significant interest in the funds. The Companys maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Companys consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment.

Impairment losses were primarily from foreign currency impacts;  Mortgage backed and asset backed securities  the Company utilized underlying data provided by asset managers, cash flow projections and additional information from credit agencies in order to determine an expected recovery value for each security. The Company believes that the OTTI included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2019 on the securities which were considered by the Company to be impaired was due to market and sector-related factors ( i.e. , not credit losses). At December 31, 2019 , the Company did not intend to sell these securities, or any other securities which were in an unrealized loss position, and determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their cost basis. The following table provides a roll forward of the amount related to credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an OTTI was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Balance at start of year $ 637 $ 767 $ 13,138 Credit loss impairments recognized on securities not previously impaired   31 Credit loss impairments recognized on securities previously impaired   210 Reductions for increases in cash flows expected to be collected that are recognized over the remaining life of the security    Reductions for securities sold during the period ( 291 ) ( 130 ) ( 12,612 ) Balance at end of year $ 346 $ 637 $ 767 Restricted Assets The Company is required to maintain assets on deposit, which primarily consist of fixed maturities, with various regulatory authorities to support its underwriting operations. The Companys subsidiaries maintain assets in trust accounts as collateral for transactions with affiliated companies and also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties The following table details the value of the Companys restricted assets: December 31, 2019 2018 Assets used for collateral or guarantees: Affiliated transactions $ 4,526,761 $ 4,623,483 Third party agreements 2,278,248 2,181,682 Deposits with U.S. regulatory authorities 797,371 689,114 Deposits with non-U.S. regulatory authorities 119,238 59,624 Total restricted assets $ 7,721,618 $ 7,553,903 In addition, Watford maintains a secured credit facility to provide borrowing capacity for investment purposes and a total return swap agreement and maintains assets pledged as collateral for such purposes. The Company does not guarantee or provide credit support for Watford, and the Companys financial exposure to Watford is limited to its investment in Watfords senior notes, common and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from reinsurance transactions. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , Watford held $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.3 billion , respectively, in pledged assets to collateralize the credit facility mentioned above.

Fair Value Accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP and provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP. It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement (Level 1 being the highest priority and Level 3 being the lowest priority). The levels in the hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for securities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such securities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The Company reviews its securities measured at fair value and discusses the proper classification of such investments with investment advisers and others. The Company determines the existence of an active market based on its judgment as to whether transactions for the financial instrument occur in such market with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. The Company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed maturity investments. To validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources, the Company's review process includes, but is not limited to: (i) quantitative analysis (e.g., comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark, with significant differences identified and investigated); (ii) a review of the prices obtained in the pricing process and the range of resulting fair values; (iii) initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value; (iv) a comparison of the fair value estimates to the Companys knowledge of the current market; (v) a comparison of the pricing services' fair values to other pricing services' fair values for the same investments; and (vi) periodic back-testing, which includes randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing the executed prices to the fair value estimates from the pricing service. A price source hierarchy was maintained in order to determine which price source would be used ( i.e. , a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases). The hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers. Based on the above review, the Company will challenge any prices for a security or portfolio which are considered not to be representative of fair value. In certain circumstances, when fair values are unavailable from these independent pricing sources, quotes are obtained directly from broker-dealers who are active in the corresponding markets. Such quotes are subject to the validation procedures noted above. Of the $ 22.9 billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2019 , approximately $ 179.6 million , or 0.8 % , were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes. Of the $ 20.4 billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2018 , approximately $ 217.9 million , or 1.1 % , were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes. Fixed maturities The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturity securities, when possible. The market approach includes obtaining prices from independent pricing services, such as index providers and pricing vendors, as well as to a lesser extent quotes from broker-dealers. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded. In general, these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing ARCH CAPITAL 133 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS source uses observable market inputs including, but not limited to, investment yields, credit risks and spreads, benchmarking of like securities, broker-dealer quotes, reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair value. The following describes the significant inputs generally used to determine the fair value of the Companys fixed maturity securities by asset class:  U.S. government and government agencies  valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The Company determined that all U.S. Treasuries would be classified as Level 1 securities due to observed levels of trading activity, the high number of strongly correlated pricing quotes received on U.S. Treasuries and other factors. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are classified within Level 2.  Corporate bonds  valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for corporate bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. During 2019, the Company transferred $ 25.8 million of corporate bonds from Level 2 to Level 3 based on a review of the pricing of such securities, as described above.  Mortgage-backed securities  valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through pricing vendors and index providers with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the expected average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. The pricing services also review prepayment speeds and other indicators, when applicable. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.  Municipal bonds  valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using spreads obtained from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for municipal bonds are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.  Commercial mortgage-backed securities  valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for commercial mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.  Non-U.S. government securities  valuations provided by independent pricing services, with all prices provided through index providers and pricing vendors. The fair values of these securities are generally based on international indices or valuation models which include daily observed yield curves, cross-currency basis index spreads and country credit spreads. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for non-U.S. government securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2.  Asset-backed securities  valuations provided by independent pricing services, substantially all through index providers and pricing vendors with a small amount through broker-dealers. The fair values of these securities are generally determined through the use of pricing models (including Option Adjusted Spread) which use spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the securities. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and from broker-dealers who trade in the relevant security market. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for asset-backed securities are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to a low level of transparency on the inputs used in the pricing process. Equity securities The Company determined that exchange-traded equity securities would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other equity securities are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are unobservable, the fair value of such securities are classified as Level 3. During the 2019 second quarter, the Company transferred $ 107.4 million of equity securities from Level 2 to Level 3 based on a review of the pricing of such securities, as described above. ARCH CAPITAL 134 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other investments The Company determined that exchange-traded investments would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Other investments also include term loan investments for which fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of term loan investments with similar characteristics, pricing models or matrix pricing. Such investments are generally classified within Level 2. A small number of securities are included in Level 3 due to the lack of an available independent price source for such securities. During 2019, the Company transferred $ 31.6 million of other investments from Level 2 to Level 3 based on a review of the pricing of such securities, as described above. Derivative instruments The Companys futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and other derivatives trade in the over-the-counter derivative market. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value for these derivatives based on significant observable market inputs from third party pricing vendors, non-binding broker-dealer quotes and/or recent trading activity. As the significant inputs used in the pricing process for these derivative instruments are observable market inputs, the fair value of these securities are classified within Level 2. Short-term investments The Company determined that certain of its short-term investments held in highly liquid money market-type funds, Treasury bills and commercial paper would be included in Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair values of other short-term investments are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve and are classified within Level 2. Contingent consideration liabilities Contingent consideration liabilities (included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) include amounts related to the Companys 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company and its affiliated mortgage insurance companies (the CMG Entities) and other acquisitions. Such amounts are remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains (losses). To determine the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, the Company estimates future payments using an income approach based on modeled inputs which include a weighted average cost of capital. The Company determined that contingent consideration liabilities would be included within Level 3. ARCH CAPITAL 135 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

(2) Gains or losses were included in net realized gains (losses). Financial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, At Fair Value The Company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its business. The carrying values of cash, accrued investment income, receivable for securities sold, certain other assets, payable for securities purchased and certain other liabilities approximated their fair values at December 31, 2019 , due to their respective short maturities. As these financial instruments are not actively traded, their respective fair values are classified within Level 2. At December 31, 2019 , the Companys senior notes were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of $ 1.87 billion and had a fair value of $ 2.34 billion . At December 31, 2018 , the Companys senior notes were carried at their cost, net of debt issuance costs, of $ 1.73 billion and had a fair value of $ 1.88 billion . The fair values of the senior notes were obtained from a third party pricing service and are based on observable market inputs. As such, the fair value of the senior notes is classified within Level 2. Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis The Company measures the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally quarterly, annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets include investments accounted for using the equity method, certain other investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and long-lived assets. The Company uses a variety of techniques to measure the fair value of these assets when appropriate, as described below: Investments accounted for using the equity method. When the Company determines that the carrying value of these assets may ARCH CAPITAL 138 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS not be recoverable, the Company records the assets at fair value with the loss recognized in income. In such cases, the Company measures the fair value of these assets using the techniques discussed above in Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis. Goodwill and Intangible Assets . The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When the Company determines goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired, the Company uses techniques including discounted expected future cash flows, to measure fair value. Long-Lived Assets . The Company tests its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. 10 . Derivative Instruments The Companys investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments. The Companys derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company utilizes exchange traded U.S. Treasury note, Eurodollar and other futures contracts and commodity futures to manage portfolio duration or replicate investment positions in its portfolios and the Company routinely utilizes foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, index futures contracts and other derivatives as part of its total return objective. In addition, certain of the Companys investments are managed in portfolios which incorporate the use of foreign currency forward contracts which are intended to provide an economic hedge against foreign currency movements. In addition, the Company purchases to-be-announced mortgage backed securities (TBAs) as part of its investment strategy. TBAs represent commitments to purchase a future issuance of agency mortgage backed securities. For the period between purchase of a TBA and issuance of the underlying security, the Companys position is accounted for as a derivative. The Company purchases TBAs in both long and short positions to enhance investment performance and as part of its overall investment strategy. The following table summarizes information on the fair values and notional values of the Companys derivative instruments: Estimated Fair Value Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Notional Value (1) December 31, 2019 Futures contracts (2) $ 10,065 $ ( 13,722 ) $ 4,104,559 Foreign currency forward contracts (2) 5,352 ( 5,327 ) 686,878 TBAs (3) 55,010  53,229 Other (2) 33,529 ( 20,701 ) 4,356,300 Total $ 103,956 $ ( 39,750 ) December 31, 2018 Futures contracts (2) $ 51,800 $ ( 2,115 ) $ 3,153,518 Foreign currency forward contracts (2) 8,147 ( 7,796 ) 1,008,907 TBAs (3) 8,292  8,132 Other (2) 13,946 ( 10,753 ) 2,213,981 Total $ 82,185 $ ( 20,664 ) (1) Represents the absolute notional value of all outstanding contracts, consisting of long and short positions. (2) The fair value of asset derivatives are included in other assets and the fair value of liability derivatives are included in other liabilities. Such amounts include risk in force on GSE credit-risk sharing transactions that are accounted for as derivatives. (3) The fair value of TBAs are included in fixed maturities available for sale, at fair value. The Company did not hold any derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments at December 31, 2019 or 2018 . The Companys derivative instruments can be traded under master netting agreements, which establish terms that apply to all derivative transactions with a counterparty. In the event of a bankruptcy or other stipulated event of default, such agreements provide that the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions, in which case all individual derivative positions (loss or gain) with a counterparty are closed out and netted and replaced with a single amount, usually referred to as the termination amount, which is expressed in a single currency. The resulting single net amount, where positive, is payable to the party in-the-money regardless of whether or not it is the defaulting party, unless the parties have agreed that only the non-defaulting party is entitled to receive a termination payment where the net amount is positive and is in its favor. Effectively, contractual close-out netting reduces the derivatives credit exposure from a gross to a net exposure. At December 31, 2019 , $ 97.8 million and $ 37.8 million , respectively, of asset derivatives and liability derivatives were subject to a master netting agreement compared to $ 80.4 million and $ 18.9 million , respectively, at December 31, 2018 . The remaining derivatives ARCH CAPITAL 139 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS included in the table above were not subject to a master netting agreement. All realized and unrealized contract gains and losses on the Companys derivative instruments are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income, as summarized in the following table: Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net realized gains (losses): Futures contracts $ 114,123 $ 48,443 $ 9,318 Foreign currency forward contracts ( 9,499 ) ( 21,770 ) ( 14,495 ) TBAs 463 ( 133 ) 9 Other 14,654 ( 10,904 ) ( 2,188 ) Total $ 119,741 $ 15,636 $ ( 7,356 ) 11 . Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests Watford Holdings Ltd. In March 2014, Watford raised approximately $ 1.1 billion of capital consisting of $ 907.3 million in common equity ( $ 895.6 million net of issuance costs) and $ 226.6 million in preference equity ( $ 219.2 million net of issuance costs and discount). The Company invested $ 100.0 million and acquired 2,500,000 common shares, and a warrant to purchase up to 975,503 additional common shares. The warrants expire on March 31, 2020, and are exercisable at any time. The exercise price of the warrants is determined on the date of exercise based on certain targeted returns for existing common shareholders. Watfords common shares are listed on the Nasdaq Select Global Market under the ticker symbol WTRE. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company owns approximately 13 % of Watfords outstanding common equity. Subsidiaries of the Company act as Watfords reinsurance and insurance underwriting managers. HPS Investment Partners, LLC (HPS) manages Watfords non-investment grade credit portfolios, and the Company manages Watfords investment grade portfolios, each under separate long term services agreements. John Rathgeber, previously Vice Chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance Group, is CEO of Watford. In addition, Maamoun Rajeh and Nicolas Papadopoulo, both officers of the Company, serve on the board of directors of Watford. The Company concluded that Watford is a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company includes the results of Watford in its consolidated financial statements. The Company concluded that Watford should be reflected in a separate operating segment (other) and provides the income statement and total investable assets, total assets and total liabilities of Watford within Note 4 . Because Watford is an independent company, the assets of Watford can be used only to settle obligations of Watford and Watford is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments. The Companys financial exposure to Watford is limited to its investment in Watfords senior notes, common shares and preferred shares and counterparty credit risk (mitigated by collateral) arising from the reinsurance transactions. The following table provides the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of Watford are reported: December 31, 2019 2018 Assets Investments accounted for using the fair value option $ 1,898,091 $ 2,312,003 Fixed maturities available for sale, at fair value 745,708 393,351 Equity securities, at fair value 65,338 32,206 Cash 102,437 63,529 Accrued investment income 14,025 19,461 Premiums receivable 273,657 227,301 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and LAE 170,973 86,445 Ceded unearned premiums 132,577 61,587 Deferred acquisition costs, net 64,044 80,858 Receivable for securities sold 16,287 24,507 Goodwill and intangible assets 7,650 7,650 Other assets 60,070 63,959 Total assets of consolidated VIE $ 3,550,857 $ 3,372,857 Liabilities Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 1,263,628 $ 1,032,760 Unearned premiums 438,907 390,114 Reinsurance balances payable 77,066 21,034 Revolving credit agreement borrowings 484,287 455,682 Senior notes 172,418  Payable for securities purchased 18,180 60,142 Other liabilities 171,714 302,524 Total liabilities of consolidated VIE $ 2,626,200 $ 2,262,256 Redeemable noncontrolling interests $ 52,305 $ 220,992 The following table summarizes Watfords cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-redeemable noncontrolling interests The Company accounts for the portion of Watfords common equity attributable to third party investors in the shareholders equity section of its consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership in Watfords senior notes, common shares was approximately 87 % at December 31, 2019 . The portion of Watfords income or loss attributable to third party investors is recorded in the consolidated statements of income in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. The following table sets forth activity in the non-redeemable noncontrolling interests: December 31, 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of year $ 791,560 $ 843,411 Additional paid in capital attributable to non-redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 2,929 )  Repurchases attributable to non-redeemable noncontrolling interests (1) ( 75,056 )  Amounts attributable to non-redeemable noncontrolling interests 40,072 ( 48,507 ) Other comprehensive (income) loss attributable to non-redeemable noncontrolling interests 9,130 ( 3,344 ) Balance, end of year $ 762,777 $ 791,560 (1) During 2019, Watfords board of directors authorized the investment in Watfords common shares through a share repurchase program. Redeemable noncontrolling interests The Company accounts for redeemable noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine section of its consolidated balance sheets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Such redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily relate to the Watford Preference Shares issued in late March 2014 with a par value of $ 0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $ 25.00 per share. The Watford Preference Shares were issued at a discounted amount of $ 24.50 per share. Holders of the Watford Preference Shares will be entitled to receive, if declared by Watfords board, quarterly cash dividends on the last day of March, June, September, and December. Dividends accrued from the closing date to June 30, 2019 at a fixed rate of 8.5 % per annum. From June 30, 2019 and subsequent, dividends will accrue based on a floating rate equal to the 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR (with a 1 % floor) plus a margin based on the difference between the fixed rate and the 5 year mid swap rate to the floating rate. Preferred dividends, including the accretion of the discount and issuance costs, are included in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Companys consolidated statements of income. Because the redemption features are not solely within the control of Watford, the Company accounts for the redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Watford Preference Shares in the mezzanine section of its consolidated balance sheets. On August 1, 2019, Watford redeemed 6,919,998 of its 9,065,200 issued and outstanding preference shares (Watford Preference Shares) at a total redemption price of $ 25.19748 per share, inclusive of all declared and unpaid dividends. The Company received $ 11.5 million pursuant to the redemption of Watford Preference Shares. Preferred dividends on the Watford Preference Shares, including the accretion of the discount and issuance costs, was $ 17.8 million for 2019 , compared to $ 19.6 million for 2018 and 2017 .

At the time the Bellemeade Agreements were entered into, the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses VIEs was evaluated. As a result of the evaluation of the Bellemeade Agreements, the Company concluded that these entities are VIEs. However, given that the ceding insurers do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to their economic performance, the Company does not consolidate such entities in its consolidated financial statements.

Earnings Per Common Share The calculation of basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to Arch common shareholders by the weighted average number of Common Shares and common share equivalents outstanding. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Numerator: Net income $ 1,693,300 $ 727,821 $ 629,709 Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 56,981 ) 30,150 ( 10,431 ) Net income available to Arch 1,636,319 757,971 619,278 Preferred dividends ( 41,612 ) ( 41,645 ) ( 46,041 ) Loss on redemption of preferred shares  ( 2,710 ) ( 6,735 ) Net income available to Arch common shareholders $ 1,594,707 $ 713,616 $ 566,502 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding 401,802,815 401,036,376 377,531,628 Series D preferred securities (1)  3,311,245 26,606,736 Weighted average common shares outstanding  basic 401,802,815 404,347,621 404,138,364 Effect of dilutive common share equivalents: Nonvested restricted shares 1,673,770 1,474,207 3,936,594 Stock options (2) 8,132,893 7,084,650 9,710,067 Weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding  diluted 411,609,478 412,906,478 417,785,025 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 3.97 $ 1.76 $ 1.40 Diluted $ 3.87 $ 1.73 $ 1.36 (1) The company has determined that, based on a review of the terms, features and rights of the Companys non-voting common equivalent preferred shares compared to the rights of the Companys common shareholders, the underlying common shares that the convertible securities convert to were common share equivalents at the time of their issuance. (2) Certain stock options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share where the exercise price of the stock options exceeded the average market price and would have been anti-dilutive or where, when applying the treasury stock method to in-the-money options, the sum of the proceeds, including unrecognized compensation, exceeded the average market price and would have been anti-dilutive. For 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the number of stock options excluded were 1,302,017 , 5,673,821 and 2,603,451 , respectively. 14 . Income Taxes Arch Capital is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and, under current Bermuda law, is not obligated to pay any taxes in Bermuda based upon income or capital gains. The Company has received a written undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits, income, gain or appreciation on any capital asset, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax will not be applicable to Arch Capital or any of its operations until March 31, 2035. This undertaking does not, however, prevent the imposition of taxes on any person ordinarily resident in Bermuda or any company in respect of its ownership of real property or leasehold interests in Bermuda. Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. federal income tax only to the extent that they derive U.S. source income that is subject to U.S. withholding tax or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. and is not exempt from U.S. tax under an applicable income tax treaty with the U.S. Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries will be subject to a withholding tax on dividends from U.S. investments and interest from certain U.S. payors (subject to reduction by any applicable income tax treaty). Arch Capital and its non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to conduct their operations in a manner that will not cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States and, therefore, will not be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes (other than U.S. excise taxes on insurance and reinsurance premium and withholding taxes on dividends and certain other U.S. source investment income). However, because there is uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, there can be no assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that Arch Capital or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If Arch Capital or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries ARCH CAPITAL 145 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS were subject to U.S. income tax, Arch Capitals shareholders equity and earnings could be materially adversely affected. Arch Capital has subsidiaries and branches that operate in various jurisdictions around the world that are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The significant jurisdictions in which Arch Capitals subsidiaries and branches are subject to tax are the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Denmark. The components of income taxes attributable to operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Current expense (benefit): United States $ 139,407 $ 73,078 $ ( 51,705 ) Non-U.S. 4,954 12,785 5,969 144,361 85,863 ( 45,736 ) Deferred expense (benefit): United States 11,849 19,544 169,093 Non-U.S. ( 400 ) 8,544 4,211 11,449 28,088 173,304 Income tax expense $ 155,810 $ 113,951 $ 127,568 The Companys income or loss before income taxes was earned in the following jurisdictions: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes: Bermuda $ 1,122,952 $ 388,492 $ 406,054 United States 701,480 440,823 381,157 Other 24,678 12,457 ( 29,934 ) Total $ 1,849,110 $ 841,772 $ 757,277 The expected tax provision computed on pre-tax income or loss at the weighted average tax rate has been calculated as the sum of the pre-tax income in each jurisdiction multiplied by that jurisdictions applicable statutory tax rate. The 2019 applicable statutory tax rates by jurisdiction were as follows: Bermuda ( 0.0 % ), United States ( 21.0 % ), United Kingdom ( 19.0 % ), Ireland ( 12.5 % ), Denmark ( 22.0 % ), Canada ( 26.5 % ), Gibraltar ( 10.0 % ), Australia ( 30.0 % ), Hong Kong ( 16.5 % ) and the Netherlands ( 19.0 % ). The United States rate was 35 % in 2017. A reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average tax rate follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Expected income tax expense (benefit) computed on pre-tax income at weighted average income tax rate $ 149,799 $ 91,529 $ 126,262 Addition (reduction) in income tax expense (benefit) resulting from: Tax-exempt investment income ( 3,091 ) ( 4,790 ) ( 13,330 ) Meals and entertainment 1,134 1,060 1,063 State taxes, net of U.S. federal tax benefit 3,314 2,086 732 Foreign branch taxes 1,231 5,428 5,752 Prior year adjustment 632 ( 2,522 ) ( 559 ) Foreign exchange gains & losses 436 1,293 ( 572 ) Changes in applicable tax rate  ( 128 ) 7,745 Dividend withholding taxes 6,510 6,594 232 Change in valuation allowance 1,628 18,396 14,798 Contingent consideration 190 740 3,785 Share based compensation ( 6,592 ) ( 5,356 ) ( 18,733 ) Other 619 ( 379 ) 393 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 155,810 $ 113,951 $ 127,568 The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred taxes assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts Act was signed into law which significantly changed the U.S. tax laws in many ways including a reduction of the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which provided guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Cuts Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete the accounting. During 2018, the Company finalized its accounting for the income tax impact of the Tax Cuts Act resulting in a tax expense of $ 1.2 million , primarily attributable to the write down of temporary differences identified following the filing of the Companys 2017 corporate tax return offset by AMT credits that were currently recoverable. ARCH CAPITAL 146 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences based on enacted tax rates between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Deferred income tax assets: Net operating loss $ 30,836 $ 24,089 Uncrystallized losses 1,565 7,960 AMT credit carryforward 1,323 2,652 Discounting of net loss reserves 52,582 43,130 Net unearned premium reserve 64,269 68,305 Compensation liabilities 21,693 20,492 Foreign tax credit carryforward 9,521 9,116 Interest expense  1,387 Goodwill and intangible assets 11,644 17,127 Bad debt reserves 5,983 5,626 Lease liability 26,438  Net unrealized foreign exchange losses 598 949 Net unrealized decline of investments  13,453 Other, net 206 3,418 Deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 226,658 217,704 Valuation allowance ( 48,219 ) ( 44,659 ) Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 178,439 173,045 Deferred income tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 1,215 ) ( 2,559 ) Deposit accounting liability ( 2,169 ) ( 2,292 ) Contingency reserve ( 132,831 ) ( 112,852 ) Deferred policy acquisition costs ( 29,847 ) ( 32,105 ) Net unrealized appreciation of investments ( 38,764 )  Right-of-use asset ( 23,416 )  Other, net ( 3,680 ) ( 735 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 231,922 ) ( 150,543 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 53,483 ) $ 22,502 The Company provides a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to an amount which management expects to more likely than not be realized. As of December 31, 2019 , the Companys valuation allowance was $ 48.2 million , compared to $ 44.7 million at December 31, 2018 . The valuation allowance in both periods was primarily attributable to valuation allowance on the Companys U.K. Canadian and Australian operations and certain other deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards that have a limited use. At December 31, 2019 , the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 Expiration Operating Loss Carryforwards United Kingdom $ 89,000 No expiration Ireland 10,200 No expiration Australia 22,000 No expiration Hong Kong 17,600 No expiration Denmark 400 No expiration United States (1) (2) 23,100 2029 - 2038 Tax Credits U.K. foreign tax credits 9,521 No expiration U.S. refundable AMT credits 1,323 No expiration (1) Includes $ 0.6 million net operating loss carryforwards from Watford. (2) On January 30, 2014, the Companys U.S. mortgage operations underwent an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Companys acquisition of the CMG Entities. As a result of this ownership change, a limitation has been imposed upon the utilization of approximately $ 8.9 million of the Companys existing U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Utilization is limited to approximately $ 0.6 million per year in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the Code). The Companys U.S. mortgage operations are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, under Section 832(e) of the Code for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. The deduction is allowed only to the extent that the Company purchases non-interest bearing U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds (T&L Bonds) issued by the U.S. Treasury Department in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from deducting any portion of the statutory contingency reserves. T&L Bonds are reflected in other assets on the Companys balance sheet and totaled approximately $ 207.0 million at December 31, 2019 , compared to $ 183.0 million at December 31, 2018 . Deferred income tax liabilities have not been accrued with respect to the undistributed earnings of the Company's U.S., U.K. and Ireland subsidiaries as it is the Companys intention that all such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. If the earnings were to be distributed, as dividends or otherwise, such amounts may be subject to withholding tax in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. The Company no longer intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the Company's Canada subsidiary, however, no income or withholding taxes have been accrued as the Canada subsidiary does not have positive cumulative earnings and profits and therefore a distribution from this particular subsidiary would not be subject to income taxes or withholding taxes. Potential tax implications of repatriation from the Companys unremitted earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are driven by facts at the time of distribution. Therefore it is not practicable to estimate the income tax liabilities that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted. Distributions from the U.K. or Ireland would not ARCH CAPITAL 147 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS be subject to withholding tax and no deferred income tax liability would need to be accrued. The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2019 , the Companys total unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were $ 2.0 million . If recognized, the full amount of the unrecognized tax benefit would impact the consolidated effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 2,008 $ 2,008 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   Additions for tax positions of prior years   Reductions for tax positions of prior years   Settlements   Balance at end of year $ 2,008 $ 2,008 The Company or its subsidiaries or branches files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The following table details open tax years that are potentially subject to examination by local tax authorities, in the following major jurisdictions: Jurisdiction Tax Years United States 2016-2019 United Kingdom 2018-2019 Ireland 2015-2019 Canada 2016-2019 Switzerland 2017-2019 Denmark 2015-2019 As of December 31, 2019 , the Companys current income tax payable (included in Other liabilities) was $ 13.5 million . 15 . Transactions with Related Parties I n 2017, the Company acquired approximately 25 % of Premia Holdings Ltd. Premia Holdings Ltd. is the parent of Premia Reinsurance Ltd., a multi-line Bermuda reinsurance company (together with Premia Holdings Ltd., Premia). Premias strategy is to reinsure or acquire companies or reserve portfolios in the non-life property and casualty insurance and reinsurance run-off market. Arch Re Bermuda and certain Arch co-investors invested $ 100.0 million and acquired approximately 25 % of Premia as well as warrants to purchase additional common equity. Arch has appointed two directors to serve on the seven person board of directors of Premia. Arch Re Bermuda is providing a 25 % quota share reinsurance treaty on certain business written by Premia. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Barbican entered into certain reinsurance and related transactions with Premia pursuant to which Premia assumed a transfer of liability for the 2018 and prior years of account of Barbican as of July 1, 2019. Barbican recorded reinsurance recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and funds held liability of $ 177.7 million and $ 180.0 million , respectively, at December 31, 2019. Certain directors and executive officers of the Company own common and preference shares of Watford. See note 11, Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests, for information about Watford. 16 . Leases In the ordinary course of business, the Company renews and enters into new leases for office property and equipment. At the lease inception date, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease and its classification as a finance or operating lease. Primarily all of the Companys leases are classified as operating leases. The Companys operating leases have remaining lease terms of up to 11 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term. The Company considers these options when determining the lease term and measuring its lease liability and right-of-use asset. In addition, the Companys lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less were excluded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and represent an inconsequential amount of operating lease expense. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Additional information regarding the Companys operating leases is as follows: December 31, 2019 Operating lease costs $ 30,478 Cash payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities reported in operating cash flows $ 27,521 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 7,445 Right-of-use assets (1) $ 131,661 Operating lease liability (1) $ 150,519 Weighted average discount rate 3.9 % Weighted average remaining lease term 6.4 years (1) The right-of-use assets are included in other assets while the operating lease liability is included in other liabilities. ARCH CAPITAL 148 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2019 : Years Ending December 31, 2020 $ 31,907 2021 30,842 2022 27,597 2023 23,027 2024 16,913 2025 and thereafter 40,167 Total undiscounted lease liability 170,453 Less: present value adjustment ( 19,934 ) Operating lease liability $ 150,519 At December 31, 2018, the future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of escalation clauses and maintenance costs and net of rental income, for all of the Companys operating leases was as follows: Years Ending December 31, 2019 $ 31,088 2020 30,491 2021 29,351 2022 26,068 2023 21,408 2024 and thereafter 54,745 Total $ 193,151 All of these leases are for the rental of office space, with expiration terms that range from 2020 to 2030. Rental expense was approximately $ 30.5 million , $ 27.6 million and $ 31.1 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At December 31, 2019 , the Company has entered into certain financing lease agreements. The future lease payments for the Companys financing leases are expected to be $ 4.8 million and $ 2.1 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively. 17 . Commitments and Contingencies Concentrations of Credit Risk The creditworthiness of a counterparty is evaluated by the Company, taking into account credit ratings assigned by independent agencies. The credit approval process involves an assessment of factors, including, among others, the counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits. Collateral may be required, at the discretion of the Company, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The areas where significant concentrations of credit risk may exist include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, contractholder receivables, ceded unearned premiums, paid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable net of reinsurance balances payable, investments and cash and cash equivalent balances. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverables as they may become uncollectible. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and, if necessary, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds, trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. In addition, certain insurance policies written by the Companys insurance operations feature large deductibles, primarily in its construction and national accounts lines of business. Under such contracts, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively. In the event that the Company is unable to collect from the policyholder, the Company would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Collateral, primarily in the form of letters of credit, cash and trusts, is obtained from the policyholder to mitigate the Companys credit risk. In the instances where the company receives collateral in the form of cash, the Company records a related liability in Collateral held for insured obligations. In addition, the Company underwrites a significant amount of its business through brokers and a credit risk exists should any of these brokers be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to the payments of insurance and reinsurance balances owed to the Company. The following table summarizes the percentage of the Companys gross premiums written generated from or placed by the largest brokers: Broker Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries 12.2 % 11.4 % 11.3 % Marsh & McLennan Companies and its subsidiaries 9.6 % 9.3 % 10.7 % No other broker and no one insured or reinsured accounted for more than 10 % of gross premiums written for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The Companys available for sale investment portfolio is managed in accordance with guidelines that have been tailored to meet specific investment strategies, including standards of diversification, which limit the allowable holdings of any single issue. There were no investments in any entity in excess of 10 % of the Companys shareholders equity at December 31, 2019 other than investments issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies. ARCH CAPITAL 149 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment Commitments The Companys investment commitments, which are primarily related to agreements entered into by the Company to invest in funds and separately managed accounts when called upon, were approximately $ 1.69 billion and $ 1.77 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Contingent Consideration Liability Pursuant to the Companys 2014 acquisition of the CMG Entities, the Company made a contingent consideration payment of $ 61.5 million in April 2019 and $ 71.7 million in April 2017. The maximum remaining amount of contingent consideration payments is $ 6.7 million over the remaining earn-out period. To the extent that the adjusted book value of the CMG Entities drops below the cumulative amount paid by the Company, no additional payments would be due. Purchase Obligations The Company has also entered into certain agreements which commit the Company to purchase goods or services, primarily related to software and computerized systems. Such purchase obligations were approximately $ 55.6 million and $ 39.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

ARCH CAPITAL 157 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 . Statutory Information The Companys insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance and/or reinsurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulations include certain restrictions on the amount of dividends or other distributions available to shareholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. The actual and required statutory capital and surplus for the Companys principal operating subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 and 2018 : December 31, 2019 2018 Actual capital and surplus (1): Bermuda $ 13,511,729 $ 11,605,652 Ireland 721,439 653,055 United States 4,440,848 4,195,477 United Kingdom 748,276 386,892 Canada 61,351 59,096 Required capital and surplus: Bermuda $ 5,492,968 $ 4,718,345 Ireland 542,703 429,117 United States 1,697,640 1,783,268 United Kingdom 349,328 271,864 Canada 32,763 33,189 (1) Such amounts include ownership interests in affiliated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. There were no state-prescribed or permitted regulatory accounting practices for any of the Companys insurance or reinsurance entities that resulted in reported statutory surplus that differed from that which would have been reported under the prescribed practices of the respective regulatory authorities, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The differences between statutory financial statements and statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary by jurisdiction, however, with the primary differences being that statutory financial statements may not reflect deferred acquisition costs, certain net deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities and certain unauthorized reinsurance recoverables and include contingency reserves. The statutory net income (loss) for the Companys principal operating subsidiaries for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Statutory net income (loss): Bermuda $ 1,876,416 $ 919,554 $ 881,665 Ireland 26,367 29,223 ( 14,438 ) United States 481,188 292,831 500,412 United Kingdom ( 17,423 ) ( 18,467 ) ( 33,257 ) Canada ( 1,023 ) 2,525 158 Bermuda The Company has two Bermuda based subsidiaries: Arch Re Bermuda, a Class 4 insurer and long-term insurer, and Watford, a Class 4 insurer. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the Insurance Act), these subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus equal to the greater of a minimum solvency margin and the enhanced capital requirement as determined by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). The enhanced capital requirement is calculated based on the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model, a risk-based model that takes into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the companys business. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, all such requirements were met. The ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited under Bermuda law and regulations. Under the Insurance Act, Arch Re Bermuda is restricted with respect to the payment of dividends. Arch Re Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25 % of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial years statutory balance sheet) unless it files, at least seven days before payment of such dividends, with the Bermuda Monetary Authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins following the declaration of those dividends. Accordingly, Arch Re Bermuda can pay approximately $ 3.10 billion to Arch Capital during 2020 without providing an affidavit to the BMA. Ireland The Company has two Irish subsidiaries: Arch Re Europe, an authorized life and non-life reinsurer, and Arch Insurance (EU), an authorized non-life insurer. Irish authorized reinsurers and insurers, such as Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU), are also subject to the general body of Irish laws and regulations including the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. Arch Re Europe and Arch Insurance (EU) are subject to the supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland (CBOI) and must comply with Irish insurance acts and regulations as well as with directions and guidance issued by the CBOI. These subsidiaries are ARCH CAPITAL 158 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS required to maintain a minimum level of capital. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, these requirements were met. The amount of dividends these subsidiaries are permitted to declare is limited to accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. The solvency and capital requirements must still be met following any distribution. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Re Europe would result in an increase in available capital at Arch Re Bermuda. United States The Companys U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The ability of the Companys regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards. These regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to shareholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Re U.S. would result in an increase in available capital at Arch-U.S., the Companys U.S. holding company. Arch Re U.S. can declare a maximum of approximately $ 130.2 million of dividends during 2020 subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance. Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company have each been approved as an eligible mortgage insurer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, subject to maintaining certain ongoing requirements (eligible mortgage insurers). In April 2015, the GSEs published comprehensive, revised requirements, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements or PMIERs. As clarified and revised by the Guidance Letters issued by the GSEs in December 2016 and March 2017, the PMIERs apply to the Companys eligible mortgage insurers, but do not apply to Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, which is not GSE-approved. The amount of assets required to satisfy the revised financial requirements of the PMIERs at any point in time will be affected by many factors, including macro-economic conditions, the size and composition of our eligible mortgage insurers mortgage insurance portfolio at the point in time, and the amount of risk ceded to reinsurers that may be deducted in our calculation of minimum required assets. The Companys U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to detailed regulation by their domiciliary and primary regulators, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (Wisconsin OCI) for Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and Arch Mortgage Guaranty Company, the North Carolina Department of Insurance (NC DOI) for United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company, and by state insurance departments in each state in which they are licensed. As mandated by state insurance laws, mortgage insurers are generally mono-line companies restricted to writing a single type of insurance business, such as mortgage insurance business. Each company is subject to either Wisconsin or North Carolina statutory requirements as to payment of dividends. Generally, both Wisconsin and North Carolina law precludes any dividend before giving at least 30 days notice to the Wisconsin OCI or NC DOI, as applicable, and prohibits paying any dividend unless it is fair and reasonable to do so. In addition, the state regulators and the GSEs limit or restrict our eligible mortgage insurers ability to pay stockholder dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. Under respective states law, our U.S. mortgage subsidiaries can declare a maximum of approximately $ 338.9 million of ordinary dividends in 2020, however, dividend capacity is limited by the respective companies unassigned surplus amounts. As of December 31, 2019, the combined unassigned surplus amount of our U.S. mortgage insurance entities would limit the dividend capacity to $ 177.8 million . In certain instances, approval by the GSEs would be required for dividends or other forms of return of capital to shareholders due to the requirements under PMIERs, including the minimum required assets imposed on our eligible mortgage insurers by the GSEs. Such dividend would result in an increase in available capital at Arch U.S. MI Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Arch-U.S. Mortgage insurance companies licensed in Wisconsin or North Carolina are required to establish contingency loss reserves for purposes of statutory accounting in an amount equal to at least 50 % of net earned premiums. These amounts generally cannot be withdrawn for a period of 10 years and are separate liabilities for statutory accounting purposes, which affects the ability to pay dividends. However, with prior regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35 % of net premiums earned in a calendar year. Under Wisconsin and North Carolina law, as well as that of 14 other states, a mortgage insurer must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its risk in force in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital vary in certain jurisdictions, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. Wisconsin and North Carolina both require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum policyholder position calculated in accordance with their respective regulations. Policyholders' position consists primarily of statutory policyholders' surplus plus the statutory contingency reserve, less ceded reinsurance. While the statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet, for risk-to-capital ratio calculations, it is included as capital for purposes of statutory capital. ARCH CAPITAL 159 2019 FORM 10-K Table of Contents ARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS United Kingdom The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulate insurance and reinsurance companies and the FCA regulates firms carrying on insurance mediation activities operating in the U.K., both under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Companys European insurance operations are conducted through Arch Insurance (U.K.), Arch Syndicate 2012 and Barbican Syndicate 1955. Arch Syndicate 2012 has one corporate member, Arch Syndicate Investments Ltd. (ASIL), and is managed by Arch Underwriting at Lloyds Ltd (AUAL). The syndicates managed by BMAL have 11 corporate members. BMAL is the managing agent of Barbican Syndicate 1955. Arch Syndicate 2012 and Barbican Syndicate 1955 provide access to Lloyds extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses. All U.K. companies are also subject to a range of statutory provisions, including the laws and regulations of the Companies Acts 2006 (as amended) (the U.K. Companies Acts). Arch Insurance (U.K.), AUAL (on behalf of itself, Arch Syndicate 2012 and ASIL) and BMAL must maintain a margin of solvency at all times under the Solvency II Directive from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. The regulations stipulate that insurers are required to maintain the minimum capital requirement and solvency capital requirement at all times. The capital requirements are calculated by reference to standard formulae defined in Solvency II. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our subsidiaries were in compliance with these requirements. As corporate members of Lloyds, ASIL and others are subject to the oversight of the Council of Lloyds. The capital required to support a Syndicates underwriting capacity, or funds at Lloyds, is assessed annually and is determined by Lloyds in accordance with the capital adequacy rules established by the PRA. The Company has provided capital to support the underwriting of Arch Syndicate 2012 and Barbican Syndicate 1955 in the form of pledged assets provided by Arch Re Bermuda. The amount which the Company provides as funds at Lloyds is not available for distribution to the Company for the payment of dividends. Lloyds is supervised by the PRA and required to implement certain rules prescribed by the PRA under the Lloyds Act of 1982 regarding the operation of the Lloyds market. With respect to managing agents and corporate members, Lloyds prescribes certain minimum standards relating to management and control, solvency and other requirements and monitors managing agents compliance with such standards. Under U.K. law, all U.K. companies are restricted from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have profits available for distribution. The calculation as to whether a company has sufficient profits is based on its accumulated realized profits minus its accumulated realized losses. U.K. insurance regulatory laws do not prohibit the payment of dividends, but the PRA or FCA, as applicable, requires that insurance companies and insurance intermediaries maintain certain solvency margins and may restrict the payment of a dividend by Arch Insurance (U.K.), AUAL, ASIL and BMAL. Canada Arch Insurance Canada and the Canadian branch of Arch Re U.S. (Arch Re Canada) are subject to federal, as well as provincial and territorial, regulation in Canada. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is the federal regulatory body that, under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), regulates federal Canadian and non-Canadian insurance companies operating in Canada. Arch Insurance Canada and Arch Re Canada are subject to regulation in the provinces and territories in which they underwrite insurance/reinsurance, and the primary goal of insurance/reinsurance regulation at the provincial and territorial levels is to govern the market conduct of insurance/reinsurance companies. Arch Insurance Canada is licensed to carry on insurance business by OSFI and in each province and territory. Arch Re Canada is licensed to carry-on reinsurance business by OSFI and in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), Arch Insurance Canada is required to maintain an adequate amount of capital in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Minimum Capital Test (MCT), and Arch Re Canada is required to maintain an adequate margin of assets over liabilities in Canada, calculated in accordance with a test promulgated by OSFI called the Branch Adequacy of Assets Test. Dividends or distributions, if any, made by Arch Insurance Canada would result in an increase in available capital at Arch Insurance Company (see United States section).

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

D PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of December 31, 2019 , for the purposes set forth in the applicable rules under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. We continue to enhance our operating procedures and internal controls (including information technology initiatives and controls over financial reporting) to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in connection with our evaluation required pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. ARCH CAPITAL 171 2019 FORM 10-K ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Disclosure of Certain Activities Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or an affiliate knowingly engaged in certain activities described in that section, including certain activities related to Iran during the period covered by the report. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries underwrite insurance and facultative reinsurance on a global basis to non-U.S. insureds and insurers, including for liability, marine, aviation and energy risks. Coverage provided to non-Iranian business may indirectly cover an exposure in Iran. For example, certain of our operations underwrite global marine hull and cargo policies that provide coverage for vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide, including Iran. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there has been no material amount of premium allocated or apportioned to activities relating to Iran, and we are unable to attribute gross revenues or net profits from any such policies because they insure multiple voyages and fleets containing multiple ships. Such non-U.S. subsidiaries will continue to provide such coverage only to the extent permitted by applicable law. Subsequent Event On February 25, 2020, the Company announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement with Natixis to purchase a 29.5% stake in Coface, a France-based leader in the global trade credit insurance market. The transaction will be completed at a price of 10.70 per share (dividend until closing attached), corresponding to a transaction value of approximately 480 million based on the current number of shares.
