=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

 1. BUSINESS Overview Allegion plc ("Allegion," "we," "us" or "the Company") is a leading global provider of security products and solutions that keep people and assets safe and secure in the places they reside, work and thrive. We create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security with a vision of seamless access and a safer world. Seamless access allows authorized, automated and safe passage and movement through spaces and places in the most efficient and frictionless manner possible. Central to our vision is partnering and developing ecosystems to create a flawless experience and enable an uninterrupted and secure flow of people and assets. We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of security and access control products and solutions across a range of market-leading brands. Our experts across the globe deliver high-quality security products, services and systems, and we use our deep expertise to serve as trusted partners to end-users who seek customized solutions to their security needs. Allegion Principal Products Door closers and controls Doors and door systems Electronic security products Software-enabled access control systems Exit devices Locks, locksets, portable locks, key systems and services Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems Other accessories Access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building and home. Many door openings are configured to maximize a rooms particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and end-user security needs. Most buildings have multiple door openings, each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific access control solutions. Each door must fit exactly within its frame, be prepared precisely for its hinges, synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door. Moreover, with the increasing adoption of the Internet of Things ("IoT"), security products  including keys  are increasingly linked electronically, integrated into software and popular consumer technology platforms and controlled with mobile applications, creating additional functionality and complexity. Seamless access capitalizes on the ability for multiple products and brands to work in tandem, allowing people and assets to move efficiently and safely by adapting access rights for various settings or use cases. These solutions can also provide insights on usage and traffic patterns to improve hygiene of high-traffic areas, boost efficiency and improve visitor, staff and tenant experiences. We believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be custom configured to meet end-users security needs is a key driver of our success. We accomplish this with:  Our extensive and versatile product portfolio, combined with our deep expertise, which enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to meet diverse security and functional specifications and to successfully and securely integrate into leading technology and systems;  Our consultative approach and expertise, which enables us to develop the most efficient and appropriate building security and access control specifications to fulfill the unique needs of our end-users and their partners, including architects, contractors, homebuilders and engineers;  Our access to and management of key channels in the market, which is critical to delivering our products in an efficient and consistent manner; and  Our enterprise excellence capabilities, including our global manufacturing operations and agile supply chain, which facilitate our ability to deliver specific product and system configurations to end-users and consumers worldwide, quickly and efficiently. We believe the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic trends, including:  Expected growth in global electronic products as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes;  Heightened awareness of security and privacy requirements;  Increased focus on touchless solutions that help promote a healthy environment; and  The shift to a digital, interconnected environment. We operate in and report financial results for two segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International, the latter of which provides security products, services and solutions primarily throughout Europe, Asia and Oceania. We sell our products and solutions under the following brands: 4 Table of Contents 5 Table of Contents We sell a wide range of security and access control solutions for end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities worldwide, including the education, healthcare, government, hospitality, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. Our leading brands include CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, SimonsVoss and Von Duprin. We believe LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin hold the No. 1 or No. 2 position in their primary product categories in North America while CISA, Interflex and SimonsVoss hold the No. 1 or No. 2 position in their primary product categories in certain European markets. 6 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated Net revenues of $2,867.4 million and Operating income of $530.2 million. History and Developments We were incorporated in Ireland on May 9, 2013, to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of what was then Ingersoll Rand plc ("Ingersoll Rand"). On December 1, 2013, we became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll Rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of Ingersoll Rand via the transfer of these businesses from Ingersoll Rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rands shareholders (the "Spin-off"). Our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories. Several of our brands were established more than 100 years ago, and many originally created their categories:  Von Duprin, established in 1908, was awarded the first exit device patent;  Schlage, established in 1920, was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock;  LCN, established in 1926, created the first door closer;  CISA, established in 1926, devised the first electronically controlled lock; and  SimonsVoss, established in 1995, created the first keyless digital transponder. We have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN in 1974. Today, we continue to develop and introduce innovative and market-leading products. For example, in 2018, we announced the formation of Allegion Ventures, a corporate venture fund with an initial allocation of $50 million to invest in and help accelerate the growth of companies that have innovative, digital-first technologies and products such as touchless access and workspace monitoring solutions that complement our core business solutions. Building on this success, in December 2021, Allegion Ventures announced a second fund with an additional allocation of $100 million to focus on investing in technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and cybersecurity. Recent examples of successful product launches by Allegion are illustrated in the table below: 7 Table of Contents Product Brands Year Innovation Residential Locks, Cylinders and Levers Schlage, Gainsborough, CISA 2019/2020/ 2021 Schlage Primus RP patented, restricted key systems, allowing the widely used, historic Schlage Obverse keyway family a path to Primus levels of security with patent coverage to 2029.

Cloud access management software (CISA AERO) expands with a new open software interface for property management systems. 8 Table of Contents Industry and Competition The global markets we serve encompass institutional, commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. We expect the security products industry will continue to benefit from favorable trends such as increased concerns about safety and security, new attention on touchless solutions that help promote a healthy environment and technology-driven innovation that enables seamless access and a better user experience as people and assets traverse multiple locations and facilities. Further, we also expect continued growth in connected security products and solutions as end-users continue to adopt newer technologies, including IoT, in their facilities and single and multi-family homes. The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world, with a number of large multi-national companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. This high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs. We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB and dormakaba Group. We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world, including from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. in the North American residential market. As we move into more technologically advanced product categories, we may also compete against new, more specialized competitors. Our success depends on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, product breadth, innovation, integration with popular technology platforms, quality and delivery capabilities, price and service capabilities. As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. Although price often serves as an important customer decision point, we also compete based on the breadth, innovation and quality of our products and solutions, our ability to custom-configure solutions to meet individual end-user requirements and our global supply chain. Products and Services We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of security and access control products and solutions across a range of market-leading brands:  Locks, locksets, portable locks and key systems and services : A broad array of cylindrical and mortise door locksets, security levers and master key systems that are used to protect and control access and a range of portable security products, including bicycle, small vehicle and travel locks. We also offer locksmith services in select locations;  Door closers, controls and exit devices : An extensive portfolio of life-safety products and solutions generally installed on fire doors and facility entrances and exits. Door controls include both mechanical door closers and automatic door operators. Exit devices, also known as panic hardware, provide rapid egress to allow building occupants to exit safely in an emergency;  Electronic security products and access control systems, including software solutions : A broad range of electrified locks, access control systems, key card and reader systems and accessories, including IoT, BLE, Power over Ethernet and cloud-based solutions;  Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems : Products and services designed to help business customers manage and monitor workforce access control parameters, attendance and employee scheduling. We also offer ongoing aftermarket services in addition to design and installation offerings;  Doors and door systems : A portfolio of hollow metal, glass and specialty doors and door systems; and  Other accessories : A variety of additional security and product components, including hinges, door pulls, door stops, bike lights, louvers, weather stripping, thresholds and other accessories, as well as certain bathroom fittings and accessibility aids. Customers We sell most of our products and solutions through distribution and retail channels, including specialty distribution, e-commerce and wholesalers. We have built a network of channel partners that help our customers choose the right solution to meet their security needs and help commercial and institutional end-users fulfill and install orders. We also sell through a variety of retail channels, including large do-it-yourself home improvement centers, multiple online and e-commerce platforms, as well as small, specialty showroom outlets. We work with our retail partners on developing marketing and merchandising strategies to maximize their sales per square foot of shelf space. Through a few of our businesses, such as Interflex and our Global Portable Security brands, we also provide products and services directly to end-users. Our 10 largest customers represented approximately 25% of our total Net revenues in 2021. No single customer represented 10% or more of our total Net revenues in 2021. 9 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing In markets where we sell through commercial and institutional distribution channels, we employ sales professionals around the world who work with a combination of end-users, security professionals, architects, contractors, engineers and distribution partners to develop specific, custom-configured solutions for our end-users needs. Our field sales professionals are assisted by specification writers who work with architects, engineers and consultants to help design door openings and security systems to meet end-users functional, aesthetic and regulatory requirements. Both groups are supported by dedicated customer care and technical sales-support specialists worldwide. We also support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts, including trade-specific advertising, cooperative distributor merchandising, digital marketing and marketing at a variety of industry trade shows. In markets in which we sell through retail and home-builder distribution channels, we have teams of sales, merchandising and marketing professionals who help drive brand and product awareness through our channel partners and to consumers. We utilize a variety of advertising and marketing strategies, including traditional consumer media, retail merchandising, digital marketing, retail promotions and builder and consumer trade shows, to support these teams. We also work actively with several industry bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards. For example, we are members of Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA), Connectivity Standards Alliance, Construction Specification Institute, Door and Hardware Institute (DHI), FiRa Consortium, Partner Alliance for Safer Schools (PASS), Physical Security Interoperability Alliance (PSIA), Security Industry Association, Security Technology Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, The European Federation of Associations of Locks and Builders Hardware Manufacturers (ARGE), ASSOFERMA (Italy), BHE (Germany) and UNIQ (France). Production and Distribution We manufacture our products in our geographic markets around the world. We operate 29 principal production and assembly facilities  14 in our Allegion Americas segment and 15 in our Allegion International segment. We own 15 of these facilities and lease the others. Our strategy is to produce in the region of use, wherever appropriate, to allow us to be closer to the end-user and increase efficiency and timely product delivery. Much of our U.S. based residential portfolio is manufactured in the Baja region of Mexico under the Maquiladora, Manufacturing and Export Services Industry ("IMMEX") program. In managing our network of production and assembly facilities, we focus on continuous improvement in customer experience, employee health and safety, productivity, resource utilization and operational excellence. We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners. In addition, third-party manufacturing and logistics providers perform certain manufacturing, storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our manufacturing and distribution network. Raw Materials We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners, where available. Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership, product management and materials management teams to procure materials for production. Where appropriate, we may enter into fixed-cost contracts to lower overall costs. We purchase a wide range of raw materials, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, as well as other parts and components, such as electronic components, to support our production facilities. During 2021, especially in the second half of the year, we experienced an acceleration of several macroeconomic challenges, including supply chain disruptions and delays; shortages in materials, including reductions in allocations of electronic components and other parts from key suppliers; and increased material and other inflation. These trends had a negative impact on our results of operations in 2021, and while we currently anticipate these challenges to continue in 2022, we are rapidly adapting to navigate these challenges.

Intellectual Property Intellectual property, inclusive of certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business. We create, protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others. We consider our CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, 10 Table of Contents SimonsVoss, Von Duprin and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. Facilities We operate through a broad network of sales offices, engineering centers, 29 principal production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world. Our active properties represent approximately 6.3 million square feet, of which approximately 40% is leased.

Because more construction and do-it-yourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters in the Northern Hemisphere, our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. However, certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth quarter due to project timing. In 2020, we experienced lower sales volumes during the second quarter, principally due to the economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic; however, this is not anticipated to be a long-term trend in the seasonality of our businesses. Net revenues by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows: First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 2021 24% 26% 25% 25% 2020 25% 21% 27% 27% 2019 23% 26% 26% 25% 11 Table of Contents Human Capital The Companys human capital strategy is based on our values and is foundational to achieving our business strategy. To ensure we attract and retain top talent, we strive for a diverse and inclusive culture that rewards performance, provides growth and development opportunities and supports employees and their families through competitive compensation, benefits and numerous volunteer and charitable giving opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,000 employees around the world, the vast majority working full time. Our employee base is supplemented by contingent labor where demand fluctuates or we experience short-term needs for specialized skills. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit programs are tailored to be competitive in the geographies where we work, including the total package (which varies by country/region) that includes hourly and salaried compensation, performance incentive and equity plans, retirement, insurance and government social welfare programs, disability and family leave, education benefits to pursue degrees and certifications and additional offerings to support financial stability and personal planning. Health and wellness programs are provided globally and contribute to a productive, sustainable workforce by empowering our employees to take personal responsibility for their health, safety and well-being. In addition, we maintain tobacco-free facilities and pursue strategies to incentivize healthy behaviors and outcome-driven rewards. Pay for performance strategies consider not only accomplishments, but how individuals achieve results. The Allegion Leadership Behaviors  be a pioneer, break boundaries, coach, champion change, be courageous and inspire  are used to identify key talent and to train and develop aspiring leaders. They also work in concert with our performance management system to reinforce our values and code of conduct in assessing how people lead and deliver top performance. Talent Attraction Our employer brand strength creates a differentiated employee experience that attracts and retains the right talent for Allegion, both now and in the future. Talent attraction efforts are focused on our unique employee value proposition and highlight a culture that reflects our core values and business objectives. These efforts begin well before people walk in our doors and begin to work for us. Around the world, our sites partner with schools and support teachers, providing mentoring, grants, scholarships, internships, co-op programs, classroom technology and on-site activities and full-time rotational programs after graduation. Our sites sponsor science, technology, engineering and math ("STEM") programs and robotics and engineering competitions. In the U.S., we also host an annual Manufacturing Day event at several of our production and assembly facilities. These programs expose students to careers in manufacturing and technology and provide educators with programming to encourage academic excellence and social development while building a pipeline of talent for Allegion. Talent attraction efforts go beyond emerging talent strategies to span core capabilities that enable the business to run, grow and transform. Key capabilities have been identified for our long-term corporate business strategy: talent, customer focus, innovation, partnering, pace and agility and collaboration. We use a variety of recruitment tactics to ensure a strong base of labor for manufacturing operations and to build the base of talent with these capabilities. Throughout the process, there is a focus on driving a technology-enabled seamless experience for internal and external candidates and hiring managers throughout the recruitment cycle. These talent attraction efforts are complemented with a total reward framework, internal learning and development paths and career growth opportunities to secure Allegion as an employer of choice, where people want to come work, stay and thrive. Talent Development and Succession Planning Talent development and succession planning at all levels of the organization are instrumental in ensuring we have the key capabilities to deliver the value proposition expected by our customers and employees. Inclusive succession planning is supported through the Allegion Leadership Behaviors, individual career mapping, assessment of performance and talent pipeline planning up to and including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). On a quarterly basis, the executive team reviews talent development, focusing on developing a diverse succession bench, as part of their quarterly business review and a key component of the Allegion Operating System, our system of annual operation to support governance, reporting processes and management of the business. These cross-functional reviews highlight individuals who are ready for new opportunities, individuals who are on a special assignment or project and individuals early in their career that demonstrate emerging leadership skills. 12 Table of Contents Learning and Development Opportunities for on-going learning and development are delivered to employees through structured coursework, on-site and expert-led training and experiential, applied development. The Allegion Academy is offered globally, supporting multiple languages and providing more than 17,000 self-guided online courses, as well as community channels on targeted skills and inclusion and diversity. We offer programs to provide successive levels of development, including reskilling and upskilling existing employees, as well as strengths-based leadership curriculum. Enterprise excellence initiatives and sprint teams expand skills in lean manufacturing and quality principles and lead to redesigning workflow to boost productivity and reduce waste. Employee-led resource and affinity groups provide enrichment opportunities for womens leadership, early-career professionals, creativity and innovation, health and fitness, community volunteering and philanthropy. Engagement, Inclusion and Diversity A commitment to engagement, inclusion and diversity is core to the Allegion Operating System. Engagement surveys provide team leaders with insights on potential areas of focus and help them prioritize and take action on their teams foundational, inclusion, growth and development needs. Strengths-based leadership is an element of our commitment to inclusion: the more employees understand their own strengths, the better equipped they are to add value and appreciate the contributions of diverse members of their teams. Inclusion and diversity are topics for learning communities, employee roundtables and ongoing, regular analysis and dialogue among our people leaders, executive leadership and our Board of Directors. We believe in fundamental standards that support our employees, including a commitment to building and maintaining diverse and inclusive workplaces, safe and healthy practices and competitive wages and benefits. We embrace all differences and similarities among colleagues and within the relationships we foster with customers, suppliers and the communities where we live and work. Whatever background, experience, race, color, national origin, religion, age, gender, gender identity, disability status, sexual orientation, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law, we make sure that potential and current employees have every opportunity for application and the opportunity to give their best at work because its the right thing to do. The combined efforts of Allegions Inclusion and Diversity Steering Committee, our Executive Leadership Team ("ELT") and, as of June 2021, a new employee-led Inclusion Council, are driving expectations and accountability while creating role models and change champions. Our engagement, inclusion and diversity strategy has three core pillars:  Learn & listen deeply: Learn to recognize biases and mitigate them. Seek to first understand the other person's perspective rather than respond or act;  Unite widely: Create a workplace where all employees feel welcomed, respected and valued, enabling customers to more easily connect with our brands through our people; and  Take action: Identify the unique things that impact our organization, our communities and our industry. During 2021, we focused on four action priorities: establish the Inclusion Council; charter and expand employee resource groups; review business policies, processes and practices; and launch the Supplier Diversity Program. In 2021, Allegion was named the winner of the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion, on the merits of our companys proactive and intentional global efforts throughout 2021. We are dedicated to fulfilling equal opportunity commitments in all decisions regarding all employment actions and at all levels of employment. In partnership with our Human Resources organization, our Equal Employment Opportunity Officer ensures that the applicable policy and procedures are appropriately established, implemented and disseminated, including those prohibiting discrimination, harassment, bullying and/or retaliation. Civic Involvement Civic involvement is part of the value proposition we offer employees and supports inclusion, diversity, growth and development. The Company and its employees provide multi-faceted support for our communities, guided by three philanthropic pillars: safety and security; wellness; and addressing the unique needs of the communities where we work, live and thrive. Corporate sponsorships and voluntary employee payroll deductions support a wide range of non-profits, including those that address housing and school security and safety; children and youth programs; education and scholarships for people of color and those who are economically disadvantaged and support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities; community safety nets for basic needs (e.g., food, shelter, transportation) for underserved people and to break the cycle of poverty; wellness, mental health, health research, emergency relief and blood supply initiatives; and programs to advance 13 Table of Contents equality, justice and address systemic bias. In addition to corporate sponsorships, site leaders and employees are encouraged to organize local volunteer and fundraising activities, provide grants to local organizations and serve on boards and committees. Respect for Human Rights Our respect for human rights is expressed in standards for our employees, our business partners, our customers and our communities. We have adopted and continue to uphold our Global Human Rights Policy, with standards that align with basic working conditions and human rights concepts advanced by international organizations such as the International Labor Organization and the United Nations. This policy also represents our own minimum standards for working conditions and human rights in our business and supply chains. In addition, we conduct risk assessments and continue to have conversations with the suppliers and companies we work with about the importance of human rights. Employee Health and Safety Employee health and safety are top priorities, and we consistently rank as the safest among leading competitors on core measures such as the total recordable incident rate. Be safe, be healthy is a core organizational value in our proactive safety culture and has guided our response to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and 2021. We have adopted numerous health and safety measures in accordance with best-practice safe hygiene guidelines issued by recognized health experts like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as any applicable government mandates. We continue to adapt to changing health conditions at a local level and support a wide range of health and safety measures, including reduced density, remote and hybrid work options for appropriate roles, cleaning and hygiene protocols, visitor management and mask-wearing. We also encourage preventative measures, including COVID-19 and influenza vaccines and booster shots. The CEO and senior executives have responsibility for risk management, employee accountability and safety hazard recognition and take a personal responsibility toward executing on safety initiatives. We monitor leading and lagging indicators related to health and safety as part of our ongoing management of the Allegion Operating System and regularly update the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors on key accomplishments and employee health and safety topics. In recognition of our efforts over the past several years to integrate sound environmental, health and safety ("EHS") management with our business operations, in 2021, we received the renowned Robert W. Campbell Award from the National Safety Council. Regulatory Matters We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., relating to environmental, health and safety concerns. We are committed to conducting our business in a safe, environmentally responsible and sustainable manner, in compliance with all applicable EHS laws and regulations, and in a manner that helps promote and protect the health and safety of our environment, associates, customers, contractors and members of our local communities worldwide. Environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters are embedded into the Allegion Operating System and, in tandem with our values and Allegion leadership behaviors, create a workplace culture committed to doing the right thing in the right way. Our Board of Directors oversees the Company's ESG initiatives, strategies, goals and performance, and Company leaders and our employees all have a responsibility to uphold excellence, as we believe ESG helps advance engagement and business vitality. We operate with principles that support our proactive commitments, including:  Integrating sound, EHS and sustainability strategies in all elements of our business functions, including objectives and measurements;  Conducting periodic, formal evaluation of our compliance status and annual review of objectives and targets;  Creating a workplace culture where all employees are responsible for safety;  Making continuous improvements in EHS and sustainability management systems and performance, including the reduction in the usage of natural resources, waste minimization, prevention of pollution and prevention of workplace accidents, injuries and risks;  Designing, operating and maintaining our facilities in a manner that minimizes negative EHS and sustainability impacts;  Using materials responsibly, including, where feasible, the recycling and reuse of materials; and  Acting in a way that shows sensitivity to community concerns about EHS and sustainability issues. We recognize that these principles are critical to our future success. We have a dedicated environmental program designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate any identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities. We also regularly evaluate our 14 Table of Contents remediation methods that are in addition to, or in replacement of, those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes. We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have, from time to time, received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal. In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future. For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, during 2021, we provided additional transparency on our sustainability priorities and progress by creating a new ESG section of the corporate website (found under the ESG tab at www.allegion.com ). The website highlights our ongoing progress and advancements in ESG, including the development of the cross-functional ESG Council which was formed in 2020 and establishing Allegions materiality matrix of ESG priorities.

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

RISK FACTORS We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements except for historical and present factual information are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, together with all the other information included in this Form 10-K, in evaluating us, our ordinary shares and our senior notes. If any of the risks below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, and as a result, you could lose all or part of your investment in us. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Strategic and Operational Risks Our business operations have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We are unable to predict the full extent to which the pandemic and related impacts, including macroeconomic impacts and the pace of global economic recovery, will continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 or mitigate this pandemic have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in various countries around the world. This pandemic has also caused, and may continue to cause, disruption to our global supply chain and business operations, in addition to the various effects noted elsewhere within the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Numerous actions taken to help limit the spread of COVID-19, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines, increased border controls and closures, business shutdowns, and other public health and government mandates that restrict business activities and travel have impacted, and will likely continue to impact our ability to carry out business as usual, including the temporary suspension of some of our operations, shortages in materials, parts and components, fluctuations in customer demand, costs associated with operational changes and an extended period of remote work arrangements for some of our employees which could increase cybersecurity risks and other operational risks. Conversely, as some governments ease their restrictions and social interactions increase prior to the widespread global distribution and adoption of effective vaccines or treatments for COVID-19, and as the COVID-19 virus mutates into more contagious or severe variants, preventative and precautionary measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increased infection and could result in increased illness among our employees, business partners and others, and lead to further business interruption. In addition, our operations, as well as a significant number of our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners have been, and continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, shortages in commodities and materials, including shortages and reductions in allocations of electronic and other components from key suppliers, labor shortages and elevated levels of employee absenteeism, freight delays and other supply chain constraints and disruptions have significantly delayed or disrupted, and may continue to adversely impact, both our suppliers and our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers. We have also experienced a significant increase in commodity, parts and material component inflation in 2021, as well as inflation in other costs, such as packaging, freight, labor and energy prices. Continued supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as continued heightened inflation, could lead to continued periodic production interruptions and other inefficiencies that could negatively impact our productivity, margin performance and our results of operations. Further, we have experienced increased labor shortages at some of our production and distribution facilities. While we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased employee turnover. A number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us, including reduced employment pools, increased competition for manufacturing employees, any unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. It is also uncertain to what extent any COVID-19 vaccine mandates, if imposed or implemented, may result in further workforce attrition. Labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our Company have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall or prolonged labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Despite our best efforts to manage and mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this pandemic, the 16 Table of Contents emergence and spread of more contagious or severe variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by public health and governmental authorities, including any unintended consequences of such actions, and the pace of global economic recovery. Further, to the extent our management is focused on mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which has required, and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources, our attention and resources may be diverted from other business matters. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and its ultimate impact on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The continued spread of COVID-19 may have further adverse impacts on our business, operations, customer demand, supply chain, cash flow generation, financial position and liquidity and may also exacerbate other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Increased competition, including from technological developments, could adversely affect our business. The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants, including multi-national, regional and small, local companies. We primarily compete on the basis of quality, innovation, expertise, effective channels to market, breadth of product offering and price. We may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases. Further, in a number of our product offerings, we compete with our retail customers and technology partners who use their own private labels. If we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors activities and initiatives, including increased competition from private label brands, the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted. In addition, we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical, electronic and digital products. Technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape. Our success depends, in part, upon the research, development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining, maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections. Securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances, recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies, services, intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete. The continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors with significant resources, could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner. Our growth is dependent, in part, on the development, commercialization and acceptance of new products and services. We must develop and commercialize new products and services that meet the varied and evolving needs of our customers and end-users in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business. The speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing. We cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, if ever, or, if commercialized, will result in returns greater than our investment. Investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market. We also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market. Changes in customer and consumer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business. We have significant customers, particularly major retailers, although no one customer represented 10% or more of our total Net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years. The loss or material reduction of business, either due to a reduction in demand from one or more of our significant customers, or our inability to timely meet the elevated level of customer demand for various reasons, the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales. We also sell our products through various trade channels, including traditional retail and e-commerce channels. If we or our major customers are not successful in navigating the shifting consumer preferences to distribution channels such as e-commerce, our expected future revenues may be negatively impacted. 17 Table of Contents If our products or solutions fail to meet certification and specification requirements, are defective, or otherwise fall short of end-users' needs and expectations, our business may be negatively impacted. The security and access control product markets we serve often have unique certification and specification requirements, reflecting local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs. While we strive to meet all certification and specification requirements, if any of our products or solutions do not meet such requirements, or contain, or are perceived to contain, defects or otherwise fall short of end-users' needs and expectations, we may incur significant costs and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted. Additionally, as end-users have continued to adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes, accelerated by the increasing adoption of IoT technologies, our industry is seeing a shift in demand from mechanical security products to electronic security products and solutions, including connected devices. Electronic security products and solutions are increasingly more sophisticated and technologically complex than the mechanical security products we sell and have an increased risk of design, cybersecurity or manufacturing defects, which could lead to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory or other assets and significant warranty and other expenses. Product quality issues can also adversely affect the end-user experience, resulting in reputational harm, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and solutions, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Further, adverse publicity, whether or not justified, or allegations of product or service quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our business and innovation strategies include making acquisitions of, and investments in, external companies. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating and financial results. We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete acquisitions with suitable candidates in the future, nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful, or otherwise result in efficient integration and creation of synergies. Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable. For these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard, and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. Further, there may be difficulties in evaluating potential acquisitions, including the possibility that our due diligence may not reveal or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other acquisition risks. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses. Acquisitions also involve numerous other risks, including:  Diversion of management's time and attention from daily operations;  Difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;  Difficulties completing the transaction in a timely manner;  Difficulties realizing synergies expected to result from acquisitions;  Difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses;  Inability to obtain regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;  Potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us;  Difficulties competing in the new markets we enter;  Assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies;  Dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities; and  Difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that, prior to the acquisition, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies. Further, as part of our innovation strategy, from time to time we invest in start-up companies and/or development stage technology or other companies. In evaluating these opportunities, we follow a structured evaluation process that considers factors such as potential financial returns, new expertise in emerging technology and business benefits. Despite our best efforts to calculate potential return and risk, some or all of the companies we invest in may be unprofitable at the time of, and 18 Table of Contents subsequent to, our investment. We may lose money in these investments, including the potential for future impairment charges on the investments, and the anticipated benefits of the technology and business relationships may be less than expected. We continually look to expand our services and products into new international markets, and as we do, we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets. In some instances, we may rely on the efforts and abilities of third-party and foreign business partners in such markets. Certain international markets may be slower than our established markets in adopting our services and products, and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. In addition to the risks outlined above, expansion into certain new markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market, including the tastes and preferences of end-users and businesses with dominant market shares. Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately not be successful, may harm our business or financial condition and/or result in impairment charges. We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business. We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business, including expanding our products or service offerings, investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services. We can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove successful. Among other negative effects, our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize. Additionally, any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business, which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital. In the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow, we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing, which may not be readily available. Our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect. We utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity. Implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. There is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented, or if implemented, will realize the expected improvements. We may not be able to effectively manage and implement restructuring initiatives or other organizational changes. We have, from time to time, restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market or product changes, performance issues, changes in strategy, acquisitions and/or other internal and external considerations. These restructuring activities and other organizational changes often result in increased restructuring costs, diversion of managements time and attention from daily operations and temporarily reduced productivity. If we are unable to successfully manage and implement restructuring and other organizational changes, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these activities or do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other organizational changes and our results of operations could be negatively affected. The effects of global climate change or other unexpected events, including global health crises, may disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our business. The effects of global climate change, such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, or the occurrence of unexpected events including wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and other severe hazards or global health crises, such as the outbreak of Ebola or the global COVID-19 pandemic, or other actual or threatened epidemic, pandemic, outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus, in the countries where we operate or sell products and provide services, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, global health crises or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers, loss of human capital, temporary or long-term disruption in the manufacturing and supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers. These events and disruptions could also adversely affect our customers and suppliers financial condition or ability to operate, resulting in reduced customer demand, delays in payments received or supply chain disruptions. Further, these events and disruptions could increase insurance and other operating costs, including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters, which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services. 19 Table of Contents In particular, the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other global health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the duration and severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other global health crisis, actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread. We may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems. We rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems, networks and services including hardware, software, firmware and technological applications and platforms (collectively, "IT Systems") to manage and operate our business from end-to-end, including ordering and managing materials from suppliers, design and development, manufacturing, marketing, selling and shipping to customers, invoicing and billing, managing our banking and cash liquidity systems, managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. There can be no assurance that our current IT Systems will function properly. We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our IT Systems. Some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures. There is no assurance that newly implemented IT Systems will improve our current systems, improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments. In addition, the implementation of new IT Systems may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and cause disruptions in our operations and, if not properly implemented and maintained, negatively impact our business. If our IT Systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits, our ability to manage our operations could be impaired. We currently rely on third-party service providers for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results. We have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to third-party service providers in order to achieve efficiencies. If such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers. Depending on the function involved, such non-performance, ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions, processing inefficiencies or security breaches. Disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us. Despite our implementation of cybersecurity measures which have focused on prevention, mitigation, resilience and recovery, our network and products, including access solutions, may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, denial of service, hacking, break-ins and similar disruptions. Cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving, and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions. The scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises, exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems, denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, as we face regulatory, reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents, as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs. Further, while we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and exclusions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. Our daily business operations also require us to collect and/or retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to customers, employees, suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, the loss or breach of such data due to various causes including material security breaches, catastrophic events, extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, system failures, computer viruses, improper data handling, programming errors, unauthorized access and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business, and as such, the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals. In addition, we operate in an environment where there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws and regulations in effect or expected to go into effect in the future, including regulations related to devices connected through IoT, in the 20 Table of Contents various jurisdictions in which we operate, and we must understand and comply with such laws and regulations while ensuring our data is secure. Our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities. Such issues could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner, they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and, as a result, our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation. Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce. Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain a workforce with the skills necessary to develop, manufacture and deliver the products and services desired by our customers. We need highly skilled and qualified personnel in multiple areas, including engineering, sales, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development, strategy and management. We must therefore continue to effectively recruit, retain and motivate highly qualified, skilled and diverse personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A shortage of these employees for various reasons, including intense competition for skilled employees, labor shortages, increased labor costs, candidates preference to work remotely, changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations, or any government or public health mandates, such as vaccine mandates, that may result in workforce attrition and difficulty with recruiting, may jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business. Disruptions in our global supply chain, including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by our supplier partners, may negatively impact our business. We procure certain products, including raw materials and other commodities, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, as well as parts, components (including electronic components) and logistical services from supplier partners located throughout the world. Our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply and delivery delays. Additionally, because not all of our supply arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts and components may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are also subject to supply and pricing risks, which could negatively impact our margin performance and results of operations. If we are unable to effectively manage these relationships, or if these third parties experience delays, disruptions, shortages of materials, labor, electronic and other components, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations, freight delays and other supply chain constraints and disruptions, or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed. Economic, Market and Financial Risks Increased prices and inflation could negatively impact our margin performance and our financial results. Increased inflation, including rising prices for raw materials, parts and components, freight, packaging, labor and energy increases the costs to manufacture and distribute our products and services, and we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers. We do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against volatility in commodity prices; however, we utilize firm purchase commitments, where possible, to help mitigate risk. The pricing of some materials, parts and components we use is based on market prices. To mitigate this exposure, we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation. Additionally, we are exposed to fluctuations in other costs such as packaging, freight, labor and energy prices. If inflation in these costs increases beyond our ability to control for them through measures such as implementing operating efficiencies, we 21 Table of Contents may not be able to increase prices to sufficiently offset the effect of various cost increases without negatively impacting customer demand, thereby negatively impacting our margin performance and results of operations. Our global operations subject us to economic risks. We are incorporated in Ireland and operate in countries worldwide. Our global operations depend on products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and the Middle East. The political, economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain. Accordingly, we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally, including:  Changes to trade agreements, sanctions, import and export regulations, including imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas, and customs duties;  Changes in applicable tax regulations and interpretations;  Economic downturns;  Social and political instability, civil strife and other geographical uncertainty;  Changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions;  Limitation of ownership rights, including expropriation of assets by a local government, and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings;  Sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries;  Difficulty in staffing and managing global operations;  Difficulty in enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;  Political unrest, national and international conflict, including war, border closures, civil disturbances and terrorist acts; and  Difficulty in transporting materials, components and products. These risks could increase our cost of doing business in the U.S. and internationally, increase our counterparty risk, disrupt our operations, disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations, increase our effective tax rate, increase the cost of our products, limit our ability to sell products in certain markets, reduce our operating margin, reduce cash flows and/or negatively impact our ability to compete. Our business relies on the institutional, commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets. Demand for our security products and solutions relies on the institutional, commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets, which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence and disposable income, corporate and government spending, work-from-home trends, availability of credit and demand for new housing and infrastructure. Weakness or instability in one or more of these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or cancel major capital projects, or otherwise choose not to make purchases, which could negatively impact the demand for our products and solutions and erode average selling prices. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchan

=== ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT ===

 II, Item 7A. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Approximately 30% of our 2021 Net revenues were derived outside the U.S., and we expect sales to non-U.S. customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated Net revenues. Although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a material impact on our results of operations. We do not hedge against all our currency exposure and therefore, our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations. We also translate assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies into U.S. dollars for our Consolidated Financial Statements based on applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. 22 Table of Contents We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $803.8 million and $113.9 million, respectively. Pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we are required to annually assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In addition, interim assessments must be performed for these and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Significant disruptions to our business or end market conditions, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures or market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges to our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible or other long-lived assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods when recognized. The capital and credit markets are important to our business. Instability in U.S. and global capital and credit markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies, could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long-term credit requirements. In particular, if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy. Our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets. Limitations on the ability of customers, suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers, limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers. There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. We have approximately $1.45 billion of outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2021. In addition, we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2021 Revolving Facility") that permits borrowings of up to an additional $500 million. Volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future. A portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, share repurchases or future business opportunities. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In such event, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, our borrowings included a variable rate term loan facility (the "2021 Term Facility", and together with the 2021 Revolving Facility, the "2021 Credit Facilities") with an outstanding balance of $250 million, which exposes us to variable interest rate risk. We are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with short-term or variable-rate borrowings under our 2021 Revolving Facility. If variable base rates under our 2021 Credit Facilities increase in the future, our Interest expense could increase. Legal and Compliance Risks We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputational matters. Our reputation and the reputation of our brands, including the perception held by our customers, end-users, business partners, investors, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business are influenced by various factors. There is an increased focus from our stakeholders on ESG practices and disclosure  and if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, in any number of ESG matters, such as environmental stewardship, inclusion and diversity, workplace conduct and support for local communities, or to effectively respond to changes in, or new, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns, our reputation or the reputation of our brands may suffer. Such damage to our reputation and the reputation of our brands may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents In addition, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or our brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or the reputation of our brands. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about product quality, safety, corporate social responsibility or other matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our financial results could suffer. Our brands are important assets of our businesses, and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation. Our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position. Unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our on-going effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations. Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business. We are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies (including, without limitation, environmental, product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, data protection, privacy and labor and employment matters) that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by GAAP, we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve, and we may be required to make additional material payments. Allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us. We may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties. In particular, we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others. In general, if it is determined that one or more of our technologies, products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others, we may be required to cease marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights. The litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by adverse publicity or improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We are subject to regulation under a variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies including laws related to anti-corruption, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering due to our global operations. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence. Our operations are subject to regulatory risks. Our U.S. and non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including fire and building codes and environmental, health and safety standards. We have incurred, and will be required to continue to incur, significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Changes to, or changes in interpretations of, current laws and regulations, including climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, could require us to increase our compliance expenditures, cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services. Altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments, increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services. In the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. 24 Table of Contents Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs under certain U.S. federal and state laws and certain non-U.S. laws are retroactive, strict and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, including the EPA and similar state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial action. These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites, including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites. For

=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

n, see "Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters." While we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts, our costs of compliance, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates. We may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. As a global business, we have a relatively complex tax structure, and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions. Since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries, we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm's length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation. Although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate, there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures, the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions. We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed, recommended or implemented changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. The U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. 25 Table of Contents As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, as amended, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. In addition, Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval. Also, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash. At our annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33% of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 5% of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders. Both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders, and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved. If the Directors' authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed, then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares, for example, as consideration for acquisitions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or treaties, changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results, as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes. The realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in Ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden and/or our effective tax rate. Moreover, other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments, which could increase our tax liability. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction. While we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden and/or our effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted, certain tax treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect. In particular, any changes and/or differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland, limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions, modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country, could subject us to increased taxation. Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax. In certain circumstances, we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax of 25% from dividends paid to our shareholders. In the majority of cases, shareholders residing in the U.S. will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares. Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax. Dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion. Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion. 26 Table of Contents Certain provisions in our Memorandum and Articles of Association, among other things, could prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association contains provisions to deter takeover practices, inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers. These provisions include, amongst others:  A provision of our Articles of Association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder (being (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of our voting shares or (ii) an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of our voting shares), subject to certain exceptions;  Rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;  The right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, subject to applicable law; and  The ability of our Board of Directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. We believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders' best interests. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent. We also will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances. Also, Irish companies, including us, may alter their Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association only with the approval of at least 75% of the votes of the companys shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 2. PROPERTIES We operate through a broad network of sales offices, engineering centers, 29 principal production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world. Our active properties represent about 6.3 million square feet, of which approximately 40% is leased. We own 15 of our production and assembly facilities, with the remainder under long-term lease arrangements. We believe that our plants have been well maintained, are generally in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, including commercial and contract disputes, employment matters, product liability claims, environmental liabilities, intellectual property disputes and tax-related matters. In our opinion, pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. This item should be read in conjunction with the Company's Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A for additional information. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Information regarding the principal market for our ordinary shares and related shareholder matters is as follows: Our ordinary shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol ALLE. As of February 10, 2022, the number of record holders of ordinary shares was 2,176. Information regarding equity compensation plans required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item is incorporated by reference from our Proxy Statement. Dividend Policy Our Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.36 per ordinary share on February 5, 2021, April 8, 2021, September 1, 2021 and December 10, 2021. On February 4, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.41 per ordinary share payable March 31, 2022. We paid a total of $129.0 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. Future dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as our ability to pay dividends in compliance with the Irish Companies Act. Under the Irish Companies Act, dividends and distributions may only be made from distributable reserves. Distributable reserves, broadly, means the accumulated realized profits of Allegion plc (ALLE-Ireland) and are unrelated to any GAAP reporting amount (e.g. retained earnings). As of December 31, 2021, we had distributable reserves of $3.7 billion. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made unless the net assets of ALLE-Ireland are equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of ALLE-Irelands called up share capital plus undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce ALLE-Irelands net assets below such aggregate.

er Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization We are a leading global provider of security products and solutions operating in two segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International. We sell a wide range of security products and solutions for end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities worldwide, including the education, healthcare, government, hospitality, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. Our leading brands include CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, SimonsVoss and Von Duprin. Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic and Industry Trends and Outlook The COVID-19 pandemic and uneven economic recovery continue to create volatility in the global economy and on our business. Throughout 2021, we experienced strong and accelerating demand for our products and services in most of the markets we serve. However, especially in the second half of the year, we also experienced an acceleration of several macroeconomic challenges that have negatively impacted our ability to meet this robust demand, such as supply chain disruptions and delays; shortages in materials, including reductions in allocations of electronic components and other parts from key suppliers; labor shortages and elevated levels of employee absenteeism due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic; and increased commodity, material component, packaging, freight and labor inflation. These challenges have also created both operational and logistical inefficiencies, which have led to periodic production interruptions and an increased level of inventory, which have negatively impacted our productivity, margin performance, working capital and cash flows. While these challenges are impacting all our global businesses, they had a more pronounced impact on our Allegion Americas operating segment in 2021. We currently anticipate these challenges to continue in 2022 and are rapidly adapting to navigate them, expecting to be well-positioned to convert demand to revenue as conditions normalize. We remain focused on providing exceptional service to our customers; implementing measures to mitigate operational and distribution inefficiencies and reduce our record high level of backlogs, such as aligning resources to re-engineer product designs and configurations to accept alternate electronic components and developing alternate sources of supply; implementing pricing initiatives to address rising production, material, freight and labor costs; and investing in business initiatives to drive future growth. We will continue to explore various options to control costs and enhance financial performance, while minimizing disruption to customers and the overall business; however, the full impacts of the pandemic and the on-going macroeconomic challenges on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remain uncertain. The pandemic and related macroeconomic challenges noted above will likely continue to impact us in numerous and evolving ways that we may not be able to accurately predict. The full impact of the pandemic will continue to depend on future developments such as the continued spread and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of future variant strains of the COVID-19 virus which may be more contagious or severe, the availability and distribution of effective medical treatments and vaccines, vaccination rates, as well as any government-imposed restrictions or mandates. Further, any new or strengthened government-imposed restrictions or mandates on the conduct of business and travel could adversely impact our ability to carry out business as usual in certain markets. The challenges and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our businesses a

under "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors". 31 Table of Contents 2021 and 2020 Significant Events Financing activities On November 18, 2021, we entered into a new $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement, consisting of the $250.0 million 2021 Term Facility and the $500.0 million 2021 Revolving Facility. The initial proceeds of $250.0 million from the 2021 Term Facility were primarily used to repay in full our previously outstanding unsecured Term Facility. All obligations under the previously outstanding Credit Agreement were satisfied, all commitments thereunder were terminated and all guarantees that had been granted in connection therewith were released. Acquisitions In July 2021, we acquired certain assets of Astrum Benelux B.V. ("Astrum Benelux") and 100% of the equity of WorkforceIT B.V. in the Netherlands ("WorkforceIT"), both of which were previously held under common control and offer workforce management technology products and solutions in the Benelux region of Europe. Both Workforce IT and the assets acquired from Astrum Benelux have been integrated into our Allegion International segment. In December 2020, we acquired Yonomi, Inc. ("Yonomi), a U.S. based smart home integration platform provider and innovation leader in IoT Cloud platforms. Yonomi has been integrated into our Allegion Americas segment. QMI Divestiture During the fourth quarter of 2020, the net assets of our Qatar Metal Industries ("QMI") business, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and accordingly, were written down to fair value, resulting in a Loss on assets held for sale of $37.9 million. On February 28, 2021, we completed our divestiture of QMI. The impacts of this divestiture on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, are reflected in the discussions below. 2020 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets As a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed interim impairment tests on the goodwill balances of our former EMEA and Asia Pacific reporting units, as well as on certain indefinite-lived trade name assets in these two regions, during the first quarter of 2020. The results of these interim impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair value of our former Asia Pacific reporting unit and three indefinite-lived trade names were impaired. Consequently, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $96.3 million were recorded during the first quarter of 2020. Further intangible asset impairment charges of $5.4 million were recorded in 2020 in our former Asia Pacific segment, relating to supply chain disruptions that reduced a brand's expected future cash flows and declines in volumes and pricing pressure for a separate subsidiary in the region. 2021 Dividends and Share Repurchases We paid quarterly dividends of $0.36 per ordinary share to shareholders on record as of March 17, 2021, June 16, 2021, September 16, 2021, and December 20, 2021. We paid a total of $129.0 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders and repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for approximately $412.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31 Dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 % of Net revenues 2020 % of Net revenues Net revenues $ 2,867.4 $ 2,719.9 Cost of goods sold 1,662.5 58.0 % 1,541.1 56.7 % Selling and administrative expenses 674.7 23.5 % 635.7 23.4 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets   % 101.7 3.7 % Loss on assets held for sale   % 37.9 1.4 % Operating income 530.2 18.5 % 403.5 14.8 % Interest expense 50.2 51.1 Other income, net (44.0) (13.0) Earnings before income taxes 524.0 365.4 Provision for income taxes 40.7 50.9 Net earnings 483.3 314.5 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.3 0.2 Net earnings attributable to Allegion plc $ 483.0 $ 314.3 Diluted net earnings per ordinary share attributable to Allegion plc ordinary shareholders: $ 5.34 $ 3.39 The discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in our results of operations for the years presented and form the basis used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the business.

cember 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2021. Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by 5.4%, or $147.5 million, compared to the same period in 2020, due to the following: Pricing 1.8 % Volume 2.7 % Acquisitions / divestitures (0.5) % Currency exchange rates 1.4 % Total 5.4 % The increase in Net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes, improved pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. These increases were slightly offset by the divestiture of our QMI business in February 2021. The increase in sales volumes for the year was principally realized during the second quarter, given the muted demand and temporary plant shut-downs we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in addition to the comparative impact of the rebound in demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the supply chain disruptions and delays and shortages in materials, components and labor discussed above resulted in lower volumes during the second half of 2021 within the Allegion Americas segment. While these challenges are expected to continue into 2022, given the current elevated demand we are experiencing, we expect volume growth to resume as conditions improve. Pricing includes increases or decreases of price, including discounts, surcharges and/or other sales deductions, on our existing products and services. Volume includes increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume of existing products and services, as well as new products and services. Cost of Goods Sold For the year ended December 31, 2021, Cost of goods sold as a percentage of Net revenues increased to 58.0% from 56.7%, due to the following: 33 Table of Contents Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity 1.2 % Volume / product mix 0.7 % Acquisitions / divestitures (0.2) % Currency exchange rates (0.1) % Restructuring / acquisition expenses (0.3) % Total 1.3 % Cost of Goods sold as a percentage of Net revenues increased primarily due to inflation in excess of pricing and productivity improvements, and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable product mix, which exceeded the benefits from sales volume growth during the year. Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of increased commodity, material component, packaging, freight and labor inflation, as well as inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges and shortages of materials, components and labor, as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our QMI divestiture. Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity includes the impact to Costs of goods sold from pricing, as defined above, in addition to productivity and inflation. Productivity represents improvements in unit costs of materials and cost reductions related to improvements to our manufacturing design and processes. Inflation includes unit costs for the current period compared to the average actual cost for the prior period, multiplied by current year volumes. Volume/product mix represents the impact due to increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume, including new products and services, including the effect of changes in the mix of products and services sold on Cost of goods sold. Selling and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2021, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net revenues increased to 23.5% from 23.4%, due to the following: Inflation in excess of productivity 0.5 % Volume leverage (0.5) % Acquisitions / divestitures (0.1) % Investment spending 0.7 % Restructuring / acquisition expenses (0.5) % Total 0.1 % Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net revenues increased primarily due to inflation in excess of productivity and increased investment spending. These increases were partially offset by favorable volume leverage, a year-over-year decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses and the beneficial impact of our QMI divestiture on current year operations. Inflation in excess of productivity reflects increases to variable compensation and a return to a more normalized level of other discretionary business spending that was reduced or delayed in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased investment spending similarly reflects a return to a full-year focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products. The increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume leverage represents the contribution margin related to changes in sales volume, excluding the impact of price, productivity, mix and inflation. Expenses related to increased head count for strategic initiatives, new facilities or significant spending for strategic initiatives or new product and channel development, are captured in Investment spending in the table above. Operating Income/Margin Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $126.7 million from the same period in 2020, and Operating margin increased to 18.5% from 14.8%, due to the following: 34 Table of Contents In millions Operating Income Operating Margin December 31, 2020 $ 403.5 14.8 % Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity (34.9) (1.7) % Volume / product mix 9.3 (0.2) % Currency exchange rates 8.1 0.1 % Investment spending (19.4) (0.7) % Acquisitions/ divestitures 4.4 0.3 % Restructuring / acquisition expenses 19.6 0.8 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 101.7 3.7 % Loss on assets held for sale 37.9 1.4 % December 31, 2021 $ 530.2 18.5 % The increase in Operating income was primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our QMI business, which did not recur in the current year. Also contributing to the increase in Operating income were favorable volume/product mix, lower year-over-year restructuring and acquisition expenses, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our QMI divestiture on current year operations. These increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending. As discussed above, inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of increased commodity, material component, packaging, freight and labor inflation; inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges; and shortages of materials, components and labor, as well as increases in variable compensation and other discretionary business spending to a more normalized level in the current year. Similarly, the increased investment spending reflects a return to a full-year focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products. The increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in Operating margin was also primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our QMI business, which did not recur in the current year. Also contributing to the increase in Operating margin were lower year-over-year restructuring and acquisition expenses, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our QMI divestiture on current year operations. These increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending as discussed above, as well as unfavorable product mix, which exceeded the margin benefits from the sales volume growth during the year. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased $0.9 million compared to 2020, primarily due to a lower weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness. Other Income, net The components of Other income, net, for the years ended December 31 were as follows: In millions 2021 2020 Interest income $ (0.4) $ (0.9) Foreign currency exchange loss 2.7 0.7 Earnings and gains from the sale of equity method investments, net (6.4) (0.3) Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income, less service cost (7.1) (2.2) Other (32.8) (10.3) Other income, net $ (44.0) $ (13.0) For the year ended December 31, 2021, Other income, net increased $31.0 million compared to 2020, primarily due to a $20.7 million gain in the fourth quarter related to a fair value remeasurement of our investment in VergeSense, Inc. This gain is included within Other in the table above. Also contributing to the increase in Other income, net, are an increase in other realized and unrealized investment gains during the year, favorable net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income, less service cost, and a gain of $6.4 million from the sale of our equity method investment in Nuki Home Solutions GmbH, which is included in Earnings and gains from the sale of equity method investments, net in the table above. These increases are partially 35 Table of Contents offset by gains of $12.8 million in the prior year, which did not recur in 2021, related to the reclassification to earnings of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments upon the liquidation of two legal entities in our former EMEA region, and which are included within Other in the table above. Provision for Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective tax rate was 7.8%, compared to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact recognized in 2020 related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions and the unfavorable tax impact recognized in 2020 related to the recording of valuation allowances, which were partially offset by an unfavorable year-over-year change in share-based compensation deductions and an unfavorable mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Review of Business Segments We operate in and report financial results for two segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International. These segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews our financial performance and makes operating decisions. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews and compensation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of Segment profit and loss. Our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income (loss) as a percentage of the segment's Net revenues. The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in Net earnings. As previously announced, effective January 1, 2021, we combined our previous operations in EMEA and Asia Pacific into a new segment named Allegion International, in addition to renaming our Americas segment "Allegion Americas". Business segment information for EMEA and Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2020, has been combined in the segment results of operations presented below to reflect this change in reportable segments. Segment Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31 In millions 2021 2020 % Change Net revenues Allegion Americas $ 2,072.2 $ 2,016.7 2.8 % Allegion International 795.2 703.2 13.1 % Total $ 2,867.4 $ 2,719.9 Segment operating income (loss) Allegion Americas $ 525.0 $ 580.2 (9.5) % Allegion International 82.4 (102.1) 180.7 % Total $ 607.4 $ 478.1 Segment operating margin Allegion Americas 25.3 % 28.8 % Allegion International 10.4 % (14.5) % Allegion Americas Our Allegion Americas segment is a leading provider of security products and solutions throughout North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America. The segment sells a broad range of products and solutions including, locks, locksets, portable locks, key systems, door closers, exit devices, doors and door systems, electronic products and access control systems to end-users in commercial, institutional and residential facilities, including the education, healthcare, government, hospitality, commercial office and single and multi-family residential markets. This segments primary brands are LCN, Schlage, Steelcraft, Technical Glass Products ("TGP") and Von Duprin. 36 Table of Contents Net revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by 2.8%, or $55.5 million, compared to the same period in 2020, due to the following: Pricing 1.9 % Volume 0.5 % Currency exchange rates 0.4 % Total 2.8 % The increase in Net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes, improved pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The increase in sales volumes for the year was principally realized during the second quarter, given the muted demand and temporary plant shut-downs we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the supply chain disruptions and delays and shortages in materials, components and labor discussed above have resulted in lower volumes during the second half of 2021. While these challenges are expected to continue into 2022, given the current elevated demand we are experiencing, we expect volume growth to resume as conditions improve. Net revenues from non-residential products were flat compared to the same period in the prior year. While we continue to see strong demand for our non-residential products, the persistent and widespread supply chain challenges and shortages in materials, components (including electronic components) and labor discussed above have led to challenges in converting this elevated demand into Net revenues. Further, the combination of these factors has also culminated in our highest non-residential product backlog to date as a company as of December 31, 2021. Net revenues from residential products increased by a low double digits percent compared to the prior year, driven significantly by the muted demand and temporary plant shut-downs we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we continue to see strong demand for our residential products due to a sustained level of DIY home projects and a robust residential housing construction market, we also experienced supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages in the second half of 2021, which we expect to continue through 2022. Additionally, growth in electronic security products and solutions has become an increased metric monitored by management and a focus of our investors. Electronic products encompass both residential and non-residential products, and include all electrified product categories including, but not limited to, electronic and electrified locks, access controls and electrified exit devices. Net revenues from the sale of electronic products decreased by a low single digits percent compared to 2020. As previously disclosed, a surge in global demand for electronic components has led to supply chain challenges and component shortages. This has led to a reduction in the allocations of electronic components we receive from key suppliers, periodic production interruptions and delays in our ability to meet the elevated level of demand for our electronic products in the second half of 2021. While considered temporary, we expect these challenges around the availability of electronic components to continue through 2022. As a result, we are actively implementing measures to mitigate the operational and distribution inefficiencies these component shortages and other challenges are creating, such as re-engineering product designs and configurations and developing alternate sources of component supply. Operating income/margin Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased $55.2 million, and Segment operating margin decreased to 25.3% from 28.8% compared to the same period in 2020, due to the following: In millions Operating Income Operating Margin December 31, 2020 $ 580.2 28.8 % Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity (31.5) (2.2) % Volume / product mix (17.3) (1.0) % Currency exchange rates 2.3 0.1 % Investment spending (14.1) (0.7) % Restructuring / acquisition expenses 5.4 0.3 % December 31, 2021 $ 525.0 25.3 % 37 Table of Contents The decreases in Segment operating income and Segment operating margin were primarily due to inflation in excess of pricing and productivity, unfavorable product mix, which exceeded the benefits from sales volume growth during the year, and increased investment spending. These decreases were partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of the increased commodity, material component, packaging, freight and labor inflation; inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges; and shortages of materials, components and labor discussed above, as well as increases in variable compensation and other discretionary business spending to a more normalized level in the current year. Similarly, the increased investment spending reflects a return to a full-year focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products. The increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Allegion International Our Allegion International segment provides security products, services and solutions primarily throughout Europe, Asia and Oceania. The segment offers end-users a broad range of products, services and solutions including locks, locksets, portable locks, key systems, door closers, exit devices, doors and door systems, electronic products and access control systems, as well as time and attendance and workforce productivity solutions. This segments primary brands are AXA, Bricard, Briton, CISA, Gainsborough, Interflex and SimonsVoss. Net revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by 13.1%, or $92.0 million, compared to the same period in 2020, due to the following: Pricing 1.5 % Volume 8.9 % Acquisitions / divestitures (2.0) % Currency exchange rates 4.7 % Total 13.1 % The increase in Net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes and foreign currency exchange rate movements, in addition to improved pricing, and were partially offset by the divestiture of our QMI business in February 2021. The higher volumes, led by our Global Portable Security businesses, were achieved across nearly all of the countries within our Allegion International segment, reflecting in part the global economic rebound in 2021, contrasted with the depressed demand and temporary plant shut-downs we experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating income (loss)/margin Segment operating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021, was favorable $184.5 million, and Segment operating margin improved to 10.4% from (14.5)% compared to the same period in 2020, due to the following: In millions Operating Income (Loss) Operating Margin December 31, 2020 $ (102.1) (14.5) % Inflation in excess of pricing and productivity (2.7) (0.5) % Volume / product mix 26.5 2.8 % Currency exchange rates 5.9 0.4 % Investment spending (2.3) (0.4) % Acquisitions / divestitures 4.4 0.8 % Restructuring / acquisition expenses 13.1 1.9 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 101.7 14.5 % Loss on assets held for sale 37.9 5.4 % December 31, 2021 $ 82.4 10.4 % The improvements in Segment operating income (loss) and Segment operating margin were primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our QMI business, which did not recur in the current year. Additional improvements were due to favorable volume/product mix, a year-over-year decrease in 38 Table of Contents restructuring and acquisition expenses, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impacts of our current year acquisition and divestiture in the Allegion International segment. These increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending. Additionally, while our Allegion International segment did not experience the supply chain disruptions and delays and other operational and logistical challenges to the same extent as our Allegion Americas segment in 2021, these challenges have increased during the fourth quarter of 2021, and we currently expect them to continue into 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and uses of liquidity The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31. For additional details, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 488.6 $ 490.3 Net cash used in investing activities (31.6) (56.7) Net cash used in financing activities $ (529.3) $ (321.9) Operating activities : Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was nearly flat compared to 2020, decreasing by $1.7 million, as increased Net earnings were offset by working capital challenges, principally stemming from the supply chain disruptions and delays and related operational and logistical interruptions discussed above. Investing activities : Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased $25.1 million compared to 2020, primarily due to cash proceeds from the sales of our equity method investment in Nuki Home Solutions GmbH and other investments, as well as a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions. Financing activities : Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $207.4 million compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase of $204.0 million in cash used to repurchase shares. Capitalization At December 31, long-term debt and other borrowings consisted of the following: In millions 2021 2020 2021 Term Facility $ 250.0 $  Term Facility  238.8 2021 Revolving Facility   Revolving Facility   3.200% Senior Notes due 2024 400.0 400.0 3.550% Senior Notes due 2027 400.0 400.0 3.500% Senior Notes due 2029 400.0 400.0 Other debt 0.3 0.6 Total borrowings outstanding 1,450.3 1,439.4 Less discounts and debt issuance costs, net (8.2) (9.8) Total debt 1,442.1 1,429.6 Less current portion of long-term debt 12.6 0.2 Total long-term debt $ 1,429.5 $ 1,429.4 In November 2021, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement), which refinanced in full our previously outstanding unsecured Credit Facilities. The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of a $250.0 million term loan facility (the 2021 Term Facility) and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Facility and, together with the 2021 Term Facility, the 2021 Credit Facilities). The 2021 Credit Facilities mature on November 18, 2026. The initial proceeds from the 2021 Term Facility of $250.0 million were used primarily to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding unsecured Term Facility. All obligations under the previously outstanding Credit Agreement were 39 Table of Contents satisfied, all commitments thereunder were terminated, and all guarantees that had been granted in connection therewith were released. The 2021 Term Facility will amortize in quarterly installments at the following rates: 1.25% per quarter starting March 31, 2022 through March 31, 2025, 2.5% per quarter starting June 30, 2025 through September 30, 2026, with the balance due on November 18, 2026. Any amounts outstanding under the 2021 Term Facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. Amounts borrowed under the 2021 Term Facility that are repaid may not be reborrowed. The 2021 Revolving Facility provides aggregate commitments of up to $500.0 million, which includes up to $100.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2021 Revolving Facility and we had $8.7 million of letters of credit outstanding. Commitments under the 2021 Revolving Facility may be reduced at any time without premium or penalty, and amounts repaid may be reborrowed. Certain fees are owed with respect to the 2021 Revolving Facility, including an unused commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2021 Revolving Facility of between 0.090% and 0.200% per year, depending on our credit rating, as well as certain other fees. Outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facilities accrue interest at our option of (i) a Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) rate plus the applicable margin or (ii) a base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.875% to 1.375% depending on our credit ratings. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Term Facility accrue interest at BSBY plus a margin of 1.125%, resulting in an interest rate of 1.271%. The 2021 Credit Facilities also contain negative and affirmative covenants and events of default that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, the 2021 Credit Facilities require us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio as defined within the agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our leverage ratio of approximately 1.8 was significantly below the covenant requirement and we do not anticipate any potential covenant concerns for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, we also have $400.0 million outstanding of 3.200% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "3.200% Senior Notes"), $400.0 million outstanding of 3.550% Senior Notes due 2027 (the "3.550% Senior Notes") and $400.0 million outstanding of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2029 (the "3.500% Senior Notes", and all three senior notes collectively, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes require semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and will mature on October 1, 2024, October 1, 2027, and October 1, 2029, respectively. Historically, the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations. At December 31, 2021, we analyzed our working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain subsidiaries made distributions and concluded that no material changes to our historic permanent reinvestment assertions are required. Scheduled principal repayments on indebtedness as of December 31, 2021 can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Expected principal and interest payments related to our long-term indebtedness in 2022 amount to $12.6 million and $45.0 million, respectively, given our current level of indebtedness and effective interest rates as of December 31, 2021. Liquidity Outlook Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development and fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities, our unused availability under our 2021 Revolving Facility and our access to the capital and credit markets enable us to fund these capital needs, as well as execute our long-term growth strategies and return value to our shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, we maintain cash and cash equivalents of $397.9 million and have unused availability of $491.3 million under our 2021 Revolving Facility. Further, our business operates with strong operating cash flows, low leverage and low capital intensity, providing financial flexibility, including sufficient access to credit markets. Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements, restructuring initiatives, capital spending, dividend payments and principal and interest payments on our long-term debt. Long-term financing needs depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including potential acquisitions, repayment or refinancing of our long-term obligations and repurchases of our ordinary shares. Based upon our operations, existing cash balances and availability under our 2021 Credit Facilities, we expect cash flows from operations to be sufficient to maintain a sound financial position and liquidity and to meet our financing needs for at least the next 12 months. Further, we do not anticipate any covenant compliance challenges with any of our outstanding indebtedness for at least the next 12 months. We also believe the availability under our 2021 Credit Facilities and access to credit and capital markets are sufficient to achieve our longer-term strategic plans. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments In addition to the scheduled principal and interest payments discussed above, our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations: Purchase Commitments  We occasionally enter into short-term, firm purchase commitments to mitigate pricing risk related to certain of our commodity, parts and component purchases, which represent commitments under enforceable and legally binding agreements. Such purchase commitments are made in the normal course of business and are not anticipated to materially impact our liquidity or financial position over the next 12 months. Leases  We have numerous real estate and equipment leasing arrangements for which we are a lessee. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information as to the short and long-term lease liabilities included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as future minimum lease payments for 2022 and future years. Defined Benefit Plans  Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases. We monitor plan funded status, asset allocation and the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans regularly in addition to investment manager performance. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to volatility in the markets. At December 31, 2021, we had net pension assets of $22.9 million, which consist of plan assets of $775.9 million and benefit obligations of $753.0 million. It is our objective to contribute to our pension plans in order to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. At December 31, 2021, the funded status of our U.S. pension plans increased to 97.2% from 92.1% at December 31, 2020. The funded status for our non-U.S. pension plans increased to 107.7% at December 31, 2021 from 101.8% at December 31, 2020. The funded status for all of our pension plans at December 31, 2021 increased to 103.0% from 97.5% at December 31, 2020. While there are no required pension contributions for 2022, we currently expect to contribute approximately $5 million to our plans worldwide in 2022. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes  At December 31, 2021, we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $41.5 million and $7.5 million of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax, although we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing over which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes. Contingent Liabilities  We are involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Guarantor Financial Information Allegion US Holding Company Inc. ("Allegion US Hold Co") is the issuer of the 3.200% Senior Notes and 3.550% Senior Notes and is the guarantor of the 3.500% Senior Notes. Allegion plc (the Parent) is the issuer of the 3.500% Senior Notes and is the guarantor of the 3.200% Senior Notes and 3.550% Senior Notes. Allegion US Hold Co is directly or indirectly 100% owned by the Parent and each of the guarantees of Allegion US Hold Co and the Parent is full and unconditional and joint and several. The 3.200% Senior Notes and the 3.550% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Allegion US Hold Co and rank equally with all of Allegion US Hold Cos existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The guarantee of the 3.200% Senior Notes and the 3.550% Senior Notes is the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent and ranks equally with all of Allegion plcs existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The 3.500% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Parent, are guaranteed by Allegion US Hold Co and rank equally with all of Allegion plcs existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Each guarantee is effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of the Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Guarantor, none of which guarantee the notes. The obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, 41 Table of Contents are limited to the amount that the Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If the Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, the Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. In such an event, the notes would be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Guarantor. For further details, terms and conditions of the Senior Notes refer to the Companys Form 8-K filed October 2, 2017 and Form 8-K filed September 27, 2019. The following tables present the summarized financial information specified in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) of Regulation S-X for each issuer and guarantor.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. 42 Table of Contents The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical:  Goodwill  Goodwill is tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair values is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market multiple of earnings (market approach), with each method being weighted in the calculation. The income approach relies on our estimates of revenue growth rates, margin assumptions and discount rates to estimate future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. These assumptions are subject to varying degrees of judgment and complexity. Estimates of future revenue growth rates and margin assumptions represent our best estimates of future cash flows given our expectations of market growth for the security products industry in the specific markets in which we operate, as well as factors such as our market positioning, brand strength, pricing and marketing efforts and other growth and productivity opportunities and initiatives. Discount rate assumptions represent our best estimates of market participant adjusted weighted-average costs of capital. Although these assumptions represent our best estimates as of the assessment date, certain factors could potentially create variances in these estimates, including but not limited to:  Decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in volumes, pricing pressures or disruptive technology;  Declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products;  The impacts of market volatility, including but not limited to, impacts of global pandemics, greater than expected inflation, supply chain disruption and delays, declines in pricing, reductions in volumes or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;  The level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products; and  Volatility in market interest rates that could impact the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The market approach requires determining an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values of our reporting units based on selected market multiples. The market approach reflects the markets expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the selected peer group companies and the subject reporting units. While market multiples are based on observable, arms-length evidence of value, these assumptions are still subject to inherent uncertainty, as the peer-group companies may differ in significant ways from one or more of our reporting units in terms of size, growth or business description characteristics. All critical accounting estimates and assumptions utilized in determining the fair values of our reporting units are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity. While we make every effort to estimate fair value as accurately as possible with the information available at the assessment date, changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets  Similar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. A significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values.  Income taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is 43 Table of Contents considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to future tax benefits. We establish valuation allowances against the realizability of any deferred tax assets, based on our consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a tax authority with respect to that return. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters and will adjust our estimates if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period the matter is finally resolved.  Defined benefit plans  We provide several U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan benefits to eligible employees and retirees. Our noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non-collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on an average pay formula while most plans for collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula. The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. Determining the costs associated with such plans is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, employee mortality and turnover rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions and when they do, are generally recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions as appropriate. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. Discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plans investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. We believe the assumptions utilized in recording our defined benefit obligations are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension benefit cost. An estimated 0.25% rate decline in the discount rate would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately $1.2 million in 2021, while a 0.25% rate decline in the estimated return on assets would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately $1.9 million.  Business combinations  The fair value of consideration paid in a business combination is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill. Acquired intangible assets primarily include indefinite-lived trade names, customer relationships and completed technologies. The accounting for business combinations involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimation, including the fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. An income approach or market approach (or both) is utilized in accordance with accepted valuation models to determine fair value. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of acquired assets include projections developed using historical information and internal forecasts, available industry and market data, estimates of long-term growth rates, profitability, customer attrition and royalty rates, which are estimated at the time of acquisition, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While we believe expectations and assumptions utilized for historical business combinations have been reasonable, they are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances occasionally do occur, and may occur in the future, which could affect the 44 Table of Contents accuracy and validity of such assumptions. The impact of future business combinations on our financial condition or results of operations may also be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates, in addition to events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition that are not reasonably anticipated when finalizing our purchase accounting estimates and assumptions. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Foreign Currency Exposures We have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world. We actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level; however, we do not hedge currency translation risk. We attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counter party non-performance, derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments. We evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates. Based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2021, a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10% adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately $9.4 million. This amount, when realized, would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions. Commodity Price Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure. We do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2021. Interest Rate Exposure Outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Credit Facilities accrue interest at our option of (i) a BSBY rate plus the applicable margin or (ii) a base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.875% to 1.375% depending on our credit ratings. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding borrowings of $250.0 million under the 2021 Term Facility accrue interest at BSBY plus a margin of 1.125%. We are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with short-term or variable-rate borrowings, as we currently have unused availability of $491.3 million under our 2021 Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2021. If our BSBY or other applicable base rates of our 2021 Credit Facilities increase in the future, our Interest expense could increase. 45 Table

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCL

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

D PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2021, that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and that such information has been accumulated and communicated to the Company's management including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 46 Table of Contents Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . We concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein. (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. F-1 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Allegion International Reporting Unit As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated goodwill balance was $803.8 million as of December 31, 2021, and the goodwill associated with the Allegion International reporting unit was $302.6 million. As disclosed by management, goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. For the annual impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of the Allegion International reporting unit was based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market multiple of earnings (market approach), with each method being weighted in the calculation. The income approach relies on managements estimates of revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, and discount rates. The market approach requires the determination of an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Allegion International reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, peer group determination, and selected market multiples; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Allegion International reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the Allegion International reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and discount rates in the income approach, and the peer group determination and selected market multiples in the market approach. Evaluating managements assumptions related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating the Companys peer group determination included assessing the appropriateness of the identified peer companies.

F-6 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1  DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Allegion plc, an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Allegion" or "the Company") are a leading global company that provides security products and solutions that keep people and assets safe and secure in the places they reside, work and thrive. Allegion creates peace of mind by pioneering safety and security with a vision of seamless access and a safer world. The Company offers an extensive and versatile portfolio of security and access control products and solutions across a range of market-leading brands including CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, SimonsVoss and Von Duprin. Basis of presentation: The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements: Principles of Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include all controlled subsidiaries of the Company. A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest in a controlled subsidiary that is not attributable to the Company. The Company includes noncontrolling interests as a component of Total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are presented as an adjustment from Net earnings used to arrive at Net earnings attributable to Allegion plc in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Equity method affiliates represent unconsolidated entities over which the Company demonstrates significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company is also required to consolidate variable interest entities in which it bears a majority of the risk to the entitys potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entitys expected returns. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends and the assessment of the probable future outcome. Some of the more significant estimates include useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, purchase price allocations of acquired businesses, valuation of assets and liabilities including goodwill and other intangible assets, product warranties, sales allowances, assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans, taxes, lease related assets and liabilities, share-based compensation, environmental costs, product liability and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period they are determined. Currency Translation: Assets and liabilities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar have been translated at year-end exchange rates, and income and expense accounts have been translated using average exchange rates throughout the year. Adjustments resulting from the process of translating a subsidiarys financial statements into the U.S. dollar are recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period they are incurred. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts : The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable, which represents the best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses inherent in the Companys accounts and notes receivable portfolios. The Company's estimates are influenced by a continuing credit evaluation of customers' financial condition, trade accounts and notes receivable aging and historical loss experience, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company has reserved $ 5.4 million and $ 6.2 million for doubtful accounts and notes receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. F-7 Table of Contents Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their economic useful life or their lease term. Repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized. The range of useful lives used to depreciate property, plant and equipment is as follows: Buildings 10 to 50 years Machinery and equipment 2 to 12 years Software 2 to 7 years The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Investments: The Company periodically invests in debt or equity securities of start-up companies and/or development stage technology or other companies without acquiring a controlling interest. The Company applies the equity method of accounting when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decision making of the investee. Investments in equity method affiliates totaled $ 11.0 million and $ 17.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values in which the Company does not have significant influence are measured at fair value, with any unrealized holding gains and losses being recorded to earnings. Investments without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are qualitatively assessed for impairment indicators each reporting period. Investments in debt and equity securities not accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled $ 35.8 million and $ 13.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company's investments are recorded within Other noncurrent assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Leases: The Company records a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and lease liability for substantially all leases for which it is a lessee. At inception of a contract, the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether or not the contract represents a lease by determining whether or not the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, either explicit or implicit, for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Judgment and estimation is also required in determining the lease classification and the amount of the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for each lease, which includes determining the appropriate lease term and an applicable discount rate. The Company assesses the specific terms and conditions of each lease to determine the appropriate classification as either an operating or finance lease. Substantially all of the Company's leases for which the Company is a lessee are classified as operating leases. In determining the appropriate length of the lease term, both the minimum period over which lease payments are required plus any renewal options that are both within the Company's control to exercise and reasonably certain of being exercised as of lease commencement are considered. If at lease commencement date, a lease has a term of less than 12 months and does not include a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the Company does not include the lease as part of its ROU asset or lease liability. If the Company enters into a large number of leases in the same month with the same terms and conditions, these are considered a group (portfolio). There are no material residual value guarantees provided by the Company nor any restrictions or covenants imposed by any leases to which the Company is a party. As a lessee, the Company categorizes its leases into two general categories: real estate leases and equipment leases. The Company's real estate leases include leased production and assembly facilities, warehouses and distribution centers and office space. The Company's equipment leases include vehicles, material handling equipment, other machinery and equipment utilized in the Company's production and assembly facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, laptops and other IT equipment and other miscellaneous leased equipment. The terms and conditions of real estate leases can vary significantly from lease to lease. The Company assesses the specific terms and conditions of each real estate lease to determine the amount of the lease payments and the length of the lease term, which includes the minimum period over which lease payments are required plus any renewal options that are both within the Company's control to exercise and reasonably certain of being exercised upon lease commencement. The Company assesses all relevant factors to determine if sufficient incentives exist as of lease commencement to conclude whether or not renewal is F-8 Table of Contents reasonably certain. When available, the Company will utilize the rate implicit in the lease as the discount rate to determine the lease liability. However, as this rate is not available for most leases, the Company will use its incremental borrowing rate for debt instruments with terms approximating the weighted-average term of its real estate or equipment leases to discount the future lease payments over the lease term to present value. The Company does incur variable lease payments for certain of its real estate leases, such as reimbursements of property taxes, maintenance and other operational costs to the lessor. In general, these variable lease payments are not captured as part of the lease liability or ROU asset, but rather are expensed as incurred. Most of the Company's equipment leases are for terms ranging from two to five years, although terms and conditions can vary from lease to lease. The Company applies similar estimates and judgments to its equipment lease portfolio in determining the lease payments, lease term and incremental borrowing rate as it does to its real estate lease portfolio. The Company does not typically incur variable lease payments related to its equipment leases. Goodwill: The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded. Goodwill is tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is compared to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. Estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market multiple of earnings (market approach), with each method being weighted in the calculation. Intangible Assets: Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than Goodwill are not amortized, but similar to Goodwill, are also tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the asset is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (i.e. Trade names) is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. Intangible assets such as completed technologies, patents, customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted-average useful lives approximate the following: Customer relationships 20 years Trade names (finite-lived) 25 years Completed technologies/patents 10 years Other 7 years Recoverability of intangible assets with finite useful lives is assessed in the same manner as property, plant and equipment, as described above. Business Combinations: The fair value of consideration paid in a business combination is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill. Acquired intangible assets primarily include indefinite-lived trade names, customer relationships and completed technologies. The accounting for business combinations involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimation, including the fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, the Company normally obtains the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. An income approach or market approach (or both) is utilized in accordance with accepted valuation models for significant acquired assets to determine fair value. Income Taxes: The calculation of the Companys income taxes involves considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent F-9 Table of Contents that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to future tax benefits. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 89.1 million, $ 82.6 million and $ 103.0 million, respectively. Product Warranties: The Company offers a standard warranty with most product sales, and the value of such warranty is included in the contractual sales price. Standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and makes adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available. Revenue Recognition: Net revenues are recognized based on the satisfaction of performance obligations under the terms of a contract. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer control of a distinct product or to provide a service, or a bundle of products or services, to a customer. The Company has two principal revenue streams, tangible product sales and services. Approximately 99% of consolidated Net revenues involve contracts with a single performance obligation, the transfer of control of a product or bundle of products to a customer. Transfer of control typically occurs when goods are shipped from the Company's facilities or at other predetermined control transfer points (for instance, destination terms). The Company's remaining Net revenues involve services, including installation and consulting. Unlike the single performance obligation to ship a product or bundle of products, revenue recognition related to services is delayed until the service based performance obligations are satisfied. In some instances, customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the service meets any established criteria. In these instances, revenue recognition is deferred until the performance obligations are satisfied, which could include acceptance terms specified in the arrangement being fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied. Net revenues are measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring control of the products or providing the services and takes into account variable consideration, such as sales incentive programs including discounts and volume rebates. The existence of these programs does not preclude revenue recognition but does require the Company's best estimate of the variable consideration to be made based on expected activity, as these items are reserved for as a deduction to Net revenues based on the Company's historical rates of providing these incentives and annual forecasted sales volumes. Sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are accounted for as variable consideration, and therefore, as a reduction to Net revenues and as a contra receivable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a customer claim accrual (contra receivable) of $ 47.7 million and $ 48.6 million, respectively. All other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain level of purchases, remain a customer for a certain period, provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are also considered variable consideration and are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and a liability. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a sales incentive accrual of $ 38.0 million and $ 35.0 million, respectively. Each of these accruals represents the Companys best estimate of the most likely amount expected to be received from customers based on historical experience. These estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy, and if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Companys results for the period in which they become known. As a practical expedient, the Company recognizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if any, as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less. The Company also applies the practical expedients allowed under ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", to omit the disclosure of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and for contracts where the Company has the right to invoice for performance completed to date. The transaction price is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component, as the time period between control transfer of goods and services is less than one year. Sales, value-added and other similar taxes collected by the Company are excluded from Net revenues. The Company has also elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related goods transfers as fulfillment activities instead of performance obligations. These activities are included in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Companys payment terms are generally consistent with the industries in which its businesses operate. Environmental Costs: The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment and is dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. The Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities. The Company regularly evaluates its remediation programs and considers alternative remediation methods that are in addition to, or in F-10 Table of Contents replacement of, those currently utilized by the Company based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes. Changes to the Company's remediation programs may result in increased expenses and increased environmental reserves. The Company is sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and has, from time to time, received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites for past operations. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, the Companys involvement is minimal. In estimating its liability, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on the Company's understanding of the parties financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future. Environmental expenditures relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities for remediation costs are recorded when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Companys commitment to a plan of action. The assessment of this liability, which is calculated based on existing technology, does not reflect any offset for possible recoveries from insurance companies and is not discounted. Research and Development Costs: The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing and improving new products and services. These costs are expensed when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to research and development activities amounted to approximately $ 73.3 million, $ 54.4 million and $ 54.7 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of salaries, wages, benefits, facility costs and other overhead expenses. Defined Benefit Plans: The Company provides a range of defined benefits, including pension, postretirement and postemployment benefits to eligible current and former employees. Determining the costs associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality and turnover rates. Actuaries perform the required calculations to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial estimates and are generally recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into Net earnings over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions as appropriate. Refer to Note 12 for further details on defined benefit plans. Share-Based Compensation: The Company records share-based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognizes compensation expense for an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payment issued in its financial statements. The Companys share-based compensation plans include programs for stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance stock units ("PSUs") and deferred compensation. The fair value of each of the Companys stock option and RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the 3-year vesting period. However, for stock options and RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value at the grant date. The Company's Performance Stock Program ("PSP") provides awards for key employees in the form of PSUs based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target award level is expressed as a number of the Company's ordinary shares. All PSUs are settled in the form of ordinary shares unless deferred. Loss Contingencies: Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental matters, product liabilities, product warranties, workers compensation and other claims. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using inputs derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve and, in certain instances, with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year. Financial Instruments: In the normal course of business, the Company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage the risks associated with interest and currency rate exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. When a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, a cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability or as an F-11 Table of Contents undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions. The Company assesses at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent the derivative is deemed to be an effective hedge, the fair market value changes of the instrument are recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified to Net earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, while changes in the fair market value of derivatives not deemed to be an effective hedge are recorded in Net earnings in the period of change. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as either assets or liabilities. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined through market-based valuations and may not be representative of the actual gains or losses that will be recorded when these instruments mature due to future fluctuations in the markets in which they are traded. If the hedging relationship ceases to be effective subsequent to inception, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains or losses on the derivative instrument will be recorded in Net earnings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes." The new guidance was intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and by updating accounting requirements around franchise taxes, goodwill recognized for tax purposes, the allocation of current and deferred tax expense among legal entities, among other minor changes. This ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those annual periods. Accordingly, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, "InvestmentsEquity Securities (Topic 321), InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815." The amendments in ASU 2020-01 clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those annual periods. Accordingly, the Company adopted ASU 2020-01 on January 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers." This ASU requires contract assets and contract liabilities (e.g. deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". Generally, this new guidance will result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. Historically, such amounts were recognized by the acquirer at fair value in purchase accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods, for any financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2022, and will apply to all business combinations consummated subsequent to this date.

The results of the interim impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair value of the former Asia Pacific reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Consequently, a goodwill impairment charge of $ 88.1 million was recorded, which is included in Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2020.

No intangible asset impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. However, as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic arising during the first quarter of 2020, the Company concluded a triggering event had occurred as of March 31, 2020, and performed interim impairment testing on certain indefinite-lived trade names. Based on these tests, it was determined that three of the Company's indefinite-lived trade names were impaired, and impairment charges of $ 8.2 million were recorded. Additional intangible asset impairment charges of $ 5.4 million were recorded in 2020, relating to supply chain disruptions, which reduced a brand's expected future cash flows, and declines in volumes and pricing pressure for a separate subsidiary. During the 2019 annual impairment testing, it was determined that two of the Company's indefinite-lived trade names were impaired, resulting in impairment charges totaling $ 5.9 million. Intangible asset impairment charges are included in Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

("Astum Benelux") and 100% of the equity of WorkforceIT B.V. in the Netherlands ("WorkforeceIT"), both of which were previously held under common control and offer workforce management technology products and solutions in the Benelux region of Europe. Neither the assets from Astrum Benelux nor the acquisition of WorkforceIT had a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Both Workforce IT and the assets acquired from Astrum Benelux were accounted for as a business combination and have been integrated into the Allegion International segment. In December 2020, the Company acquired the remaining interest of Yonomi, Inc. ("Yonomi"), a U.S. based smart home integration platform provider and innovation leader in IoT Cloud platforms, through one of its subsidiaries. Prior to acquisition, the Company held a noncontrolling interest in Yonomi that was considered an equity method investment. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Yonomi has been integrated into the Allegion Americas segment. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $ 4.4 million, $ 2.3 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, of acquisition and integration related expenses, which are included in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Under this approach, the Company applies discounting using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligations and service cost cash flows. The expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation and is based on what is achievable given the plans investment policy, the types of assets held and target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. Each plan is reviewed, along with its historical returns and target asset allocations, to determine the appropriate expected return on plan assets to be used. The Company's overall objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. The goal is to achieve this while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Each plans funded status and asset allocation is monitored regularly in addition to investment manager performance.

The Company made employer contributions of $ 6.2 million, $ 6.3 million and $ 6.0 million to the U.S. pension plans in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company made required and discretionary contributions to its non-U.S. pension plans of $ 6.0 million, $ 5.1 million and $ 10.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company currently projects that approximately $ 5 million will be contributed to its plans worldwide in 2022. The Companys policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of or less than the pension cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. The Company anticipates funding the plans in 2022 in accordance with contributions required by funding regulations or the laws of each jurisdiction. Most of the Companys U.S. employees are covered by defined contribution plans. Employer contributions are determined based on criteria specific to the individual plans and amounted to approximately $ 18.3 million, $ 17.9 million and $ 15.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Companys contributions relating to non-U.S. defined contribution plans and other non-U.S. benefit plans were $ 8.6 million, $ 7.0 million and $ 6.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan The Company maintains an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP"), which is an unfunded, nonqualified plan that, prior to 2019, permitted certain employees to defer up to 50% of their annual salary and up to 100% of their annual bonus awards, performance stock plan awards and restricted stock units earned until conclusion of their employment with the Company. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the deferred compensation liability balance was $ 18.2 million and $ 18.1 million, respectively, which was recorded within Postemployment and other benefit liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions The Company sponsors a postretirement ("OPEB") plan that provides for healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits, that cover certain eligible retired employees. The Company funds postretirement benefit obligations principally on a pay-as-you-go basis. Generally, postretirement health benefits are contributory with contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory. Net periodic postretirement benefit income is included within Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The benefit obligation related to the Company's postretirement plans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.4 million and $ 5.2 million, respectively, and is classified as Accrued compensation and benefits and Postemployment and other benefit liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net periodic postretirement benefit income was not material for any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019, nor is it projected to be material for 2022. Benefit payments for postretirement benefits, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidies, are expected to be less than $ 1 million per year for the foreseeable future. NOTE 13  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on a framework that utilizes the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of the three levels described below:  Level 1  Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3  Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. F-23 Table of Contents The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2021, were as follows: Fair value measurements Total fair value In millions Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Recurring fair value measurements Assets: Investments $  $ 24.5 $  $ 24.5 Derivative instruments  0.5  0.5 Total asset recurring fair value measurements $  $ 25.0 $  $ 25.0 Liabilities: Derivative instruments $  $ 0.4 $  $ 0.4 Deferred compensation and other retirement plans  25.9  25.9 Total liability recurring fair value measurements $  $ 26.3 $  $ 26.3 Financial instruments not carried at fair value Total debt $  $ 1,510.4 $  $ 1,510.4 Total financial instruments not carried at fair value $  $ 1,510.4 $  $ 1,510.4 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2020, were as follows: Fair value measurements Total fair value In millions Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Recurring fair value measurements Assets: Investments $  $ 23.5 $  $ 23.5 Derivative instruments  1.6  1.6 Total asset recurring fair value measurements $  $ 25.1 $  $ 25.1 Liabilities: Derivative instruments $  $ 3.4 $  $ 3.4 Deferred compensation and other retirement plans  25.1  25.1 Total liability recurring fair value measurements $  $ 28.5 $  $ 28.5 Financial instruments not carried at fair value Total debt $  $ 1,541.4 $  $ 1,541.4 Total financial instruments not carried at fair value $  $ 1,541.4 $  $ 1,541.4 The Company determines the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies:  Investments  These instruments include equity mutual funds and corporate bond funds. The fair value is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments.  Derivative instruments  These instruments include foreign currency contracts for non-functional currency balance sheet exposures, including both those that are and are not designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of the foreign currency contracts is determined based on a pricing model that uses spot rates and forward prices from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable. F-24 Table of Contents  Deferred compensation and other retirement plans - These include obligations related to deferred compensation and other retirement plans adjusted for market performance. The fair value is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments.  Debt  These instruments are recorded at cost and include senior notes maturing through 2029. The fair value of the long-term debt instruments is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts and notes receivable, net, Accounts payable, Accrued compensation and benefits and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. As discussed in Note 2, the Company also has investments in debt and equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer and are qualitatively assessed for impairment indicators at each reporting period. As these investments are considered to be nonrecurring fair value measurements, they are not included in the fair value tables above. The methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021, are the same as those used at December 31, 2020.

Stock Options / RSUs The average fair value of the stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was estimated to be $ 24.99 , $ 25.62 and $ 19.58 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Dividend yield 1.32 % 0.99 % 1.23 % Volatility 27.14 % 20.70 % 21.44 % Risk-free rate of return 0.75 % 1.41 % 2.53 % Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years 6.0 years Volatility is based on the Company's historic volatility. The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award. The expected life of the Companys stock option awards is derived from the simplified approach based on the weighted-average time to vest and the remaining contractual term and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding.

Performance Stock In February 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company's Compensation Committee granted PSUs that were earned based 50% upon a performance condition, measured at each reporting period by earnings per share ("EPS") performance in relation to pre-established targets set by the Compensation Committee, and 50% upon a market condition, measured by the Companys relative total shareholder return ("TSR") against the S&P 400 Capital Goods Index over a three-year performance period. The fair values of the market conditions are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach in a risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon historical volatility, risk-free rates of return and correlation matrix. The following table summarizes PSU activity for the maximum number of shares that may be issued for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: PSUs Weighted-average grant date fair value (a) Outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2018 156,041 $ 65.07 Granted 68,125 87.02 Vested ( 56,773 ) 61.00 Forfeited ( 10,045 ) 68.63 Outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2019 157,348 75.82 Granted 92,913 113.54 Vested ( 101,638 ) 83.16 Forfeited ( 2,647 ) 121.43 Outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2020 145,976 93.89 Granted 92,717 109.53 Vested ( 80,194 ) 100.26 Forfeited ( 13,332 ) 115.92 Outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2021 145,167 $ 98.34 (a) The weighted-average grant date fair value represents the fair value of the awards on the grant date converted to ordinary shares of the Company. F-28 Table of Contents At December 31, 2021, there was $ 6.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from the PSP based on current performance, which is related to unvested shares. This compensation will be recognized over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period. Deferred Compensation Prior to 2019, the Company allowed key employees to defer a portion of their eligible granted PSUs and/or compensation into a number of investment choices including its ordinary share equivalents. Any amounts invested in ordinary share equivalents will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at the time of distribution. NOTE 16  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 4.3 million, $ 25.6 million and $ 16.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with restructuring activities. Restructuring activities in each period were primarily associated with the Allegion International segment and related to workforce reductions intended to optimize and simplify operations and cost structure, although approximately $ 9 million of the restructuring charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, related to the Allegion Americas segment and Corporate. Restructuring expenses for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, are primarily included within Cost of goods sold and Selling and administrative expenses, although $1.9 million of the 2019 restructuring charges related to pension curtailment costs and are included within Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The changes in the restructuring reserve during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows: In millions Total December 31, 2019 $ 1.2 Additions, net of reversals 25.0 Cash payments ( 21.3 ) Currency translation 0.4 December 31, 2020 5.3 Additions, net of reversals 3.8 Cash payments ( 8.6 ) Currency translation ( 0.1 ) December 31, 2021 $ 0.4 The majority of the costs accrued as of December 31, 2021, will be paid within one year. The Company also incurred other non-qualified restructuring charges of $ 0.8 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 5.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represent costs directly attributable to restructuring activities, but that do not fall into the severance, exit or disposal category. Non-qualified restructuring charges are included within Cost of goods sold and Selling and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. NOTE 17  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET At December 31, the components of Other (income) expense, net were as follows: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Interest income $ ( 0.4 ) $ ( 0.9 ) $ ( 1.8 ) Foreign currency exchange loss 2.7 0.7 1.8 (Earnings and gains from the sale of) losses from equity method investments, net ( 6.4 ) ( 0.3 ) 0.1 Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit (income) cost, less service cost ( 7.1 ) ( 2.2 ) 6.8 Other ( 32.8 ) ( 10.3 ) ( 3.1 ) Other (income) expense, net $ ( 44.0 ) $ ( 13.0 ) $ 3.8 Other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, included unrealized gains related to the Company's investments in debt and equity securities of $ 25.6 million, the largest of which was a gain of $ 20.7 million related to the fair value remeasurement of the Company's investment in VergeSense, Inc. upon an observable price change in an orderly external F-29 Table of Contents funding round. These gains are included within Other in the table above. Other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, also included a gain of $ 6.4 million from the sale of the Company's equity method investment in Nuki Home Solutions GmbH. Other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, included gains of $ 12.8 million related to the reclassification to earnings of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments upon the liquidation of two legal entities in the Company's former EMEA segment. These gains are included within Other in the table above. NOTE 18  INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31 were taxed within the following jurisdictions: In millions 2021 2020 2019 U.S. $ 74.5 $ 151.4 $ 211.1 Non-U.S. 449.5 214.0 264.1 Total $ 524.0 $ 365.4 $ 475.2 The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the tax cost on the Company's international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, the impact of internal restructurings and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains or losses on strategic business decisions. The components of the Provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 were as follows: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Current tax expense: U.S. $ 57.4 $ 55.0 $ 87.1 Non-U.S. 27.1 20.3 16.2 Total: 84.5 75.3 103.3 Deferred tax benefit: U.S. ( 38.3 ) ( 13.4 ) ( 25.2 ) Non-U.S. ( 5.5 ) ( 11.0 ) ( 5.0 ) Total: ( 43.8 ) ( 24.4 ) ( 30.2 ) Total tax expense: U.S. 19.1 41.6 61.9 Non-U.S. 21.6 9.3 11.2 Total $ 40.7 $ 50.9 $ 73.1 The Provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income, as a result of the following differences: Percent of pretax income 2021 2020 2019 Statutory U.S. rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase (decrease) in rates resulting from: Non-U.S. tax rate differential (1) ( 14.1 ) ( 17.5 ) ( 10.6 ) State and local income taxes (1) 1.1 2.4 3.0 Reserves for uncertain tax positions 0.3 1.1 0.5 Tax on unremitted earnings ( 0.1 ) ( 0.1 ) 0.1 Trade incentives   0.2 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  7.3  Impact of divestitures   1.6 Other adjustments ( 0.4 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 0.4 ) Effective tax rate 7.8 % 13.9 % 15.4 % (1) Net of changes in valuation allowances F-30 Table of Contents The majority of the Company's earnings are considered permanently reinvested, and therefore, the Company has not recorded any incremental withholding or income tax liabilities on earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, a summary of the deferred tax accounts was as follows: In millions 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Inventory and accounts receivable $ 6.5 $ 6.5 Fixed assets and intangibles 3.2 2.6 Lease liabilities 21.6 22.0 Postemployment and other benefit liabilities 24.9 29.9 Other reserves and accruals 12.9 16.4 Net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards 446.0 386.1 Other 0.6 1.8 Gross deferred tax assets 515.7 465.3 Less: deferred tax valuation allowances ( 265.5 ) ( 259.7 ) Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances $ 250.2 $ 205.6 Deferred tax liabilities: Fixed assets and intangibles $ ( 110.6 ) $ ( 112.0 ) Right of use assets ( 21.0 ) ( 21.7 ) Postemployment and other benefit liabilities ( 13.9 ) ( 6.8 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 1.9 ) ( 1.4 ) Other ( 10.3 ) ( 5.6 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 157.7 ) ( 147.5 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 92.5 $ 58.1 At December 31, 2021, $ 1.9 million of deferred taxes were recorded for certain undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Historically, no deferred taxes have been provided for any portion of the remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries since these earnings have been, and will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. For many reasons, including the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the Company's legal entity structure, the complexity of tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions and the impact of projections of income for future years to any calculations, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon the distribution of earnings. At December 31, 2021, the Company had the following tax losses and tax credit carryforwards available to offset taxable income in prior and future years: In millions Amount Expiration Period U.S. Federal tax loss carryforwards $ 17.7 2027-Unlimited U.S. Federal and State credit carryforwards 23.4 2025-2037 U.S. State tax loss carryforwards 52.1 2022-Unlimited Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards $ 1,013.7 2025-Unlimited The U.S. state loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions. The non-U.S. loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions, predominantly in China, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. The Company evaluates its deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. GAAP requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a "more likely than not" standard. This assessment considers the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. F-31 Table of Contents Activity associated with the Companys valuation allowance is as follows: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 259.7 $ 241.0 $ 357.1 Increase to valuation allowance 8.4 21.1 2.8 Decrease to valuation allowance ( 2.0 ) ( 2.8 ) ( 118.6 ) Foreign exchange translation ( 0.6 ) 0.4 ( 0.3 ) Ending balance $ 265.5 $ 259.7 $ 241.0 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the valuation allowance increased by $ 5.8 million, while during the year ended December 31, 2020, the valuation allowance increased by $ 18.7 million. The increases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are the result of changes in country specific tax laws, internal restructurings, jurisdictional profitability and changes in judgments and facts regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The Company has total unrecognized tax benefits of $ 41.5 million and $ 41.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $ 40.4 million as of December 31, 2021. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 41.2 $ 37.3 $ 42.0 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 8.8 6.0 5.7 Additions based on tax positions related to prior years 3.6 4.1 1.7 Reductions based on tax positions related to prior years ( 2.2 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 7.0 ) Reductions related to settlements with tax authorities ( 3.6 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 4.0 ) Reductions related to lapses of statute of limitations ( 5.6 ) ( 5.2 ) ( 0.8 ) Translation (gain)/loss ( 0.7 ) 0.8 ( 0.3 ) Ending balance $ 41.5 $ 41.2 $ 37.3 The Company records interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions within its provision for income taxes. The Company had reserves associated with interest and penalties, net of tax, of $ 7.5 million and $ 7.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 0.5 million and $ 1.9 million in interest and penalties, net of tax, related to these uncertain tax positions. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of ongoing audits and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could potentially be reduced by up to approximately $ 8.7 million during the next 12 months. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a tax authority with respect to that return. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.S. In general, the examination of the material tax returns of subsidiaries of the Company is complete for the years prior to 2009, with certain matters being resolved through appeals and litigation. NOTE 19  EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) Basic EPS is calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Allegion plc by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which in the Companys case, includes shares issuable under share-based compensation plans. F-32 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Weighted-average number of basic shares 89.9 92.3 93.6 Shares issuable under share-based compensation plans 0.6 0.5 0.7 Weighted-average number of diluted shares 90.5 92.8 94.3 At December 31, 2021, 0.1 million stock options were excluded from the computation of weighted-average diluted shares outstanding because the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive. NOTE 20  NET REVENUES The following table shows the Company's Net revenues related to both tangible product sales and services for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, disaggregated by business segment. Net revenues are shown by tangible product sales and services, as contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar within each of the two principal revenue streams: 2021 In millions Allegion Americas Allegion International Consolidated Net revenues Products $ 2,070.4 $ 763.1 $ 2,833.5 Services 1.8 32.1 33.9 Total Net revenues $ 2,072.2 $ 795.2 $ 2,867.4 2020 In millions Allegion Americas Allegion International Consolidated Net revenues Products $ 2,016.7 $ 672.2 $ 2,688.9 Services  31.0 31.0 Total Net revenues $ 2,016.7 $ 703.2 $ 2,719.9 2019 In millions Allegion Americas Allegion International Consolidated Net revenues Products $ 2,114.5 $ 704.9 $ 2,819.4 Services  34.6 34.6 Total Net revenues $ 2,114.5 $ 739.5 $ 2,854.0 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, neither the contract assets related to the Company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed nor the contract liabilities associated with contract revenue were material. The Company does not have any costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that are capitalized on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no adjustments related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods were recorded. NOTE 21  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product warranty matters. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Environmental Matters The Company incurred $ 0.9 million, $ 7.1 million and $ 1.7 million of expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by the Company. F-33 Table of Contents Environmental remediation costs are recorded in Costs of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $ 16.4 million and $ 21.1 million, respectively. The total reserve at December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $ 4.3 million and $ 4.4 million, respectively, related to remediation of sites previously disposed by the Company. Environmental reserves are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of their expected future payment. The Company's total current environmental reserve at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $ 3.7 million and $ 6.1 million, respectively, and the remainder is classified as noncurrent. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain. Warranty Liability The changes in the standard product warranty liability for the years ended December 31, were as follows: In millions 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 16.5 $ 15.9 $ 14.5 Reductions for payments ( 10.6 ) ( 7.3 ) ( 8.4 ) Accruals for warranties issued during the current period 11.9 8.2 10.3 Changes to accruals related to preexisting warranties  ( 0.6 ) ( 0.4 ) Translation ( 0.1 ) 0.3 ( 0.1 ) Balance at end of period $ 17.7 $ 16.5 $ 15.9 Standard product warranty liabilities are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of the expected future payments. NOTE 22  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company classifies its business into the following two reportable segments based on industry and market focus: Allegion Americas and Allegion International. The Company largely evaluates performance based on Segment operating income and Segment operating margins. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Companys chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews and compensation. For these reasons, the Company believes that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. The Companys chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base operating decisions. The Company defines Segment operating margin as Segment operating income (loss) as a percentage of the segment's Net revenues. As previously announced, effective January 1, 2021, the Company combined its previous operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia Pacific into a new segment named Allegion International, in addition to renaming its Americas segment "Allegion Americas". Business segment information for EMEA and Asia Pacific for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, has been combined in the table below to reflect this change in reportable segments.
