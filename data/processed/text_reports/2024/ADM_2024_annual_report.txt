Internal Investigation Background As previously disclosed, the Company received a voluntary document request from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) relating to intersegment sales between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. In response, the Company initiated an internal investigation regarding certain accounting practices and procedures with respect to its Nutrition reporting segment, including as related to certain intersegment sales (the Investigation). As previously disclosed on January 21, 2024, the Company placed Vikram Luthar, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, on administrative leave. Correction of Certain Segment-Specific Historical Financial Information The Company has historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified certain intersegment sales that occurred between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. Because each sale to be adjusted occurred between the Companys reporting segments, the adjustments have no impact on the Companys consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), or cash flows. T he Company determined that the adjustments are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results and Operations included in Part II, Item 7 herein, and Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. Government Investigations The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC. Following the Companys January 21, 2024 announcement of the Investigation, the Company received voluntary document requests from the Department of Justice (the DOJ) focused primarily on the same subject matter, and the DOJ directed grand jury subpoenas to certain current and former Company employ

 is cooperating with the DOJ. 8 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) Methods of Distribution The Companys products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers facilities. The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world. The Company owns or leases trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges, towboats, and ocean-going vessels used to transport the Companys products to its customers. Concentration of Revenues by Product The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods: % of Revenues Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 Soybeans 18% 17% 18% Soybean Meal 13% 12% 12% Corn 12% 14% 14% Status of New Products The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products. Acquisitions expand the Companys ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers evolving and expanding needs through its offerings of natural flavor and ingredient products. The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Companys revenues in 2024. Source and Availability of Raw Materials A significant majority of the Companys raw materials are agricultural commodities. In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Companys raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials. Some of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks. For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes. In addition, when not managed appropriately, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions. However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices. In 2022, ADM launched its re: generations program to engage and encourage growers in its supply chain to implement regenerative agriculture practices. In the first year of the program, the Company exceeded its goal to enroll one million acres. In 2023, the Company expanded its regenerative agriculture program to cover two million acres across 18 U.S. states and Canada and also extended the program into new geographies, launching regenerative agriculture projects in Europe and South America, w

roll four million acres globally by 2025. 9 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) Under the stewardship of ADMs Board of Directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations. These policies set the standards that govern the Companys approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADMs positions on issues of widespread public interest. These standards are included in, among others, the Companys Code of Conduct; Environment, Health, and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities; Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms; Statement on Animal Testing; Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance; Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Companys website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information). In addition to policies, a portion of the Companys commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol. These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria. ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs. Trademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property The Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $734 million as of December 31, 2023. More than 90% of these intangibles are in the Nutrition segment which is not materially dependent upon any individual trademark, brand, recipe or other intellectual property. Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Companys principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest. The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Companys working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels. No material part of the Companys business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. Competition The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Companys asset portfolio. The Companys Nutrition business is a vertically integrated business that provides ingredients and solutions for human, animal, and pet in a highly competitive environment with a variety of companies offering the same products and services. The industry includes ingredient suppliers, contract manufacturers, global fast moving consumer goods companies, and private label brands, as well as smaller companies that specialize in specific niche markets. The Company focuses on staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and science-based solutions, building direct-to-consumer sales channels and focusing on consumer needs, expanding into new markets, building strategic partnerships, leverag

hnology, and building a strong distribution network. 10 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) Research and Development (R&D) R&D expense, net of reimbursements of government grants, for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $256 million. The Company is committed to global health and sustainable products, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. ADM  s R&D efforts focus on creating science-based products, solutions, and technologies aligned with macro trends in food security, sustainable processes, health, and personalized nutrition. The Company strategically invests in R&D across the entire nutrition value chain by leveraging its access to innovative processes and product optimization. The R&D team is also engaged in BioSolutions initiatives which is a key part of ADMs commitment to utilize its value chain to reduce its carbon footprint, redesign core products with sustainable alternatives, and explore new markets. The Companys internal R&D network, consisting of approximately 1,600 talented employees, is dedicated to transforming aspirations into solutions and brand innovation. The integration of interdisciplinary experts in biology, chemistry, physiology, nutrition, agronomy, and product development provides a competitive edge. R&D teams are closely connected to customers and the global markets. Targeted product development leverages innovative ingredients and ADMs existing portfolio across different segments. R&D innovation centers across four continents enable the rapid transformation of ideas into products. An external network of collaborators, including customers, key opinion leaders, start-ups, and academia amplifies the Companys scientific excellence. The scope and application of the Companys technical capabilities reinforce its commitment to global health and sustainable products. High-throughput screening and characterization facilities strengthen ADMs extensive ingredient database. Formulation platforms enable rapid upscaling or downscaling for cost-effective innovation. Resources dedicated to functional ingredient characterization enhance the Companys capacity to deliver on the science behind each product. ADMs R&D strategy prioritizes fulfilling customer expectations and supporting the Companys growth. In 2023, ADM introduced over 40 new products aligned with short and medium-term customer needs. The Companys future strategy aims to deliver world-class solutions more efficiently and sustainably, and to capitalize on ADMs full potential. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) The Company knows that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that its commitments to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world. ADM is committed to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, industrial and consumer products, energy, and packaging materials while pursuing ways to continually improve the Companys efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental sustainability. The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) blueprint as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. ADM focuses its efforts toward goals that align with its business objectives and allow the Company to make the greatest contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Zero Hunger, Clean Water an

cent Work and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land. 11 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) Governance The Sustainability Committee of the Board actively oversees the Companys objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters. The Sustainability Committee also oversees the Companys compliance with sustainability and corporate responsibility laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the Companys operations as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect ADMs reputation. Both the Companys Chief Sustainability Officer and Senior Vice President of Global Operations attend committee meetings as management representatives. The Senior Vice President, Chief People and Diversity Officer meets periodically with the Sustainability Committee to discuss ADMs diversity progress and strategy. The Executive Council of ADM, the Companys highest strategic and operational body, provides close supervision of the Companys ESG efforts and in-depth review of sustainability issues. Furthermore, regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate sustainability team, support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive sustainability efforts in the Companys facilities and supply chains around the world. ADMs sustainability efforts are also supported by functional expertise throughout the Company such as in Operations and Utilities, Supply Chain and Procurement, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). Strategy The Company aims to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity through renewable product and process innovations, supply chain efforts including a commitment to no-deforestation or native vegetation conversion and regenerative agriculture, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of ADMs production plants throughout its global operations. ADM believes sustainability is critical to its future growth strategy. ADMs strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and technologies in sustainability to help the Company grow and create value for its stakeholders. Ag Services and Oilseeds is focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working with growers on low carbon agricultural practices and products. Carbohydrate Solutions is focused on decarbonization efforts that increasingly position the segment to offer low-carbon intensity feedstocks for biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions, to replace petroleum-based products. Nutrition is working with suppliers and customers to identify nature positive solutions that can reduce environmental impact in supply chains. The growth of these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 1.5C threshold indicated by the United Nations. Additionally, beginning in 2022, the Company incorporated the achievement of gender parity and GHG emission goals to executive performance measurement to reflect the strategic importance of ESG to its business. Moreover, ADM has a large industrial footprint and believes it is important to reduce GHG emissions related to its business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its GHG emissions globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change. In 2020, ADM announced its environmental stewardship goals, collectively called Strive 35  an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline, reduce energy intensity by 15%, reduce water intensity by 10%, and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate. To support the Companys Strive 35 environmental goals, ADM developed a feasibility study with a leading engineering professional services firm that provides the technology pathway for absolute reduction of GHG by 2035. The Company has also committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community well-being in priority watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by 2025. In 2023, ADM refined two of its Strive 35 commitments to more meaningfully drive progress: ADM aims to reduce its absolute water withdrawal by 10%, from a 2019 baseline, by 2035, and ADM aims to increase its use of low-carbon energy sources to 25% of total energy used by 2035. In 2021, ADM announced its Scope 3 GHG reduction goal, focused upon the five most material Scope 3 categories for the Company: purchased goods and services; fuel and energy related emissions; upstream transportation and distribution; waste; and processing of solid products/goods. ADM aims to reduce its absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25% from a 2021 baseline by 2035. ADM has applied for approval of its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG reduction goals from the Science-bas

=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

ative (SBTi). This approval is pending SBTis review and engagement with ADM. 12 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) As of December 31, 2022, the Company reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 7.8% and realized no reductions in Scope 3 emissions. The Company reduced absolute water withdrawal by 1.0% and realized no reductions in water intensity. The Company realized no increase in low carbon energy usage and achieved 82.4% of its waste diverted from landfill. In 2023, the Company published an updated Carbon Reduction Program Assessment, a report of ADMs carbon reduction progress and exploration to support its aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The report can be accessed through the Companys website at http://www.adm.com. The Company anticipates spending between $360 million and $490 million on capital projects to achieve the Strive 35 targets. ADM has spent $158 million on projects in support of these goals since inception, of which $71 million was spent in 2023, including three projects in Ag Services and Oilseeds designed to fully transition away from coal usage. The Company believes that protection of natural resources, habitats, and biodiversity are important to life and to the Companys business. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Companys supply chains by 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities by 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. In 2022, the Company achieved full traceability of its direct and indirect sourcing throughout its soy supply chains in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company spent $69 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and in light of requirements of various environmental agencies. There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. ADMs corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns the Companys corporate giving with its business strategies and sustainability objectives. Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress. The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support food security, health and well-being, and sustainability around the world. Scenario Analysis In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures, ADM conducted an analysis using three scenarios: 1.5C (based on IPCC SSP1), 2C (based on IEA WEO 450 Scenario), and 2.6C (based on IEA INDC Scenario). The first scenario assumes a rapid transition to a low carbon world in the next decade, limiting temperature increase of 1.5C. This involves a high degree of transformation across the economy. Under this scenario, the worst anticipated physical impacts of climate change are avoided. The second scenario involves ambitious actions to mitigate climate change, limiting temperature increase of 2C. This scenario requires greater policy action; however, there is still an increase in physical climate-related impacts. The third scenario is based on the current status quo with no changes to policies or actions and an anticipated increase in global temperature of 2.6C resulting in increased physical impacts of climate change. In each of the scenarios, the Company identified potential sourcing shifts and limitations, operational changes, physical impacts, and opportunities. The primary risks identified fall into

physical and transition. Key opportunities are related to product and service offerings. 13 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) Physical Risks  Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could lead to increased direct costs from the disruption of supply chains and impair the Companys ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner.  Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could lead to increased sourcing costs due to limited availability of agricultural commodities and impact ADMs ability to produce goods, which would directly affect revenues. Transition Risks  Emerging regulation and carbon pricing mechanisms could result in increased operational costs and/or tax liabilities in the short to medium term.  Market demand has a direct effect on production, as well as sustainable sourcing initiatives. Changes in consumer demands could result in additional cost of implementation that may not be overcome by product sales.  ADM uses coal-fired cogeneration technology to meet a sizeable portion of its energy demand. The Company is working to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations and making capital investments in its facilities and new technologies. Products and Services Opportunities  Development and expansion of low-emission goods and services could lead to increased revenues resulting from increased demand. As various renewable fuel standards are implemented around the world, ADM has an opportunity to capitalize on the increased demand through the production and sale of ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel.  As more businesses and consumers look to renewable products, development of new products or services could lead to increased revenues through access to new and emerging markets. The Company reviewed the results of the scenario analysis with a cross-functional team of individuals from finance, strategy, sustainability, operations, legal, and risk management. As part of the Companys Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, the risks identified from the scenario analysis have been reviewed by the ERM team for mitigation actions. The risks are also reviewed by the ERM team on a quarterly basis to ensure they remain relevant. Risk Management See Item 1A, Risk Factors for the discussion of climate-related risks. Metrics and Targets Metrics and targets are available in ADMs Corporate Sustainability Report which can be accessed through its website at http://www.adm.com.

Income Taxes The Company has a responsibility to oversee that all ADM businesses within the Company follow responsible tax practices. ADM manages its tax affairs based upon the following key principles:  a commitment to paying tax in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates;  a commitment to the effective, sustainable, and active management of the Companys tax affairs; and  developing and sustaining open and honest relationships with the governments and jurisdictions in which the Company operates regarding the formulation of tax laws. Human Capital and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ADMs purpose of unlocking the power of nature to enrich the quality of life highlights the significant role ADM plays within an essential industry and the critical job each employee has within the Company. ADM has long maintained its Code of Conduct to help the Company achieve the right results, the right way. The code establishes high standards of honesty and integrity for all ADM colleagues and business partners, and sets forth spec

Part of ADMs vision is to foster an inclusive culture with equitable opportunities for all employees so that all members of its diverse, global workforce belong and make meaningful contributions to the success of each other and the Company. The Companys comprehensive DE&I strategy is focused on Recruitment, Advancement, Development, Retention and Culture, and is supported by a global DE&I council, which reflects the Companys global business strategy across four regions of the world. In support of ADMs commitment to a productive, diverse, and inclusive workforce, it is a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion TM and a member of Paradigm for Parity. At the industry level, ADM founded and currently participates in Together We Grow, a consortium of agricultural industry leaders united in a shared belief that American agricultures best days are yet to come. Emphasizing diversity and inclusion, Together We

ild a modern workforce with the skills, experience, and capabilities needed to keep pace with the growing world. 15 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) ADMs early career programs are focused on attracting and cultivating a diverse pipeline of early career talent which will become future leaders in the organization. Recruitment partnerships with a variety of organizations ensure that ADM engages with, supports, recruits, and hires inclusively, from front line production associates, to interns, to college graduates that begin their career across ADMs business units, functions and regions. In 2021, ADM launched the first of its Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The inaugural group focused on women as part of the Companys DE&I vision and strategy. The ERGs, also known as Affinity Groups, are voluntary, employee-led groups where colleagues with shared experiences, interests or goals can come together in a safe space to provide support, build a sense of community, and promote personal and professional development. Recognizing the broad spectrum of intersectionality, the Company has expanded its ERGs in 2022 across its four regions (North America, APAC, EMEA, and LATAM) to include, depending on geographic relevance, Multicultural, Black Colleague, Hispanic, Veterans, and LGBTQIA affinity groups. ADMs ERGs are open to all employees. ADM holds an annual Global Week of Understanding, a signature week-long investment focused on continuous learning and strengthening ADMs culture of belonging. The week features keynote presentations, training programs, ERG roundtable sessions, and onsite inclusion activities that foster an environment where all can thrive, and diversity of perspectives are harnessed to fuel innovation and growth. Compensation and Benefits ADM offers market-competitive pay, benefits, and services that help meet the needs of its employees. The Companys global rewards package includes base pay, short-term incentive plans, long-term equity grants, paid time-off, employee assistance programs, and benefits that meet the country-specific competitive markets in which ADM operates. ADMs global bonus plan has clearly defined enterprise metrics and objectives which are the same for all eligible employees  creating a strong team spirit and fostering collaboration among colleagues. Employee Development All ADM employees participate annually in training and development that further increases knowledge, skills, and awareness on current and important topics. In addition, ADM offers many voluntary training opportunities, including in-person, virtual and on-demand training that have largely moved to virtual and on-demand learning. Among the offerings are an Ability to Connect Program that cultivates business language skills to foster collaboration and LinkedIn Learning Platform which offers access to over 16,000 courses in 7 languages to support career development. ADMs leadership development program, Ability to Lead, focuses on enabling innovation, driving productivity, developing talent, change leadership, building trust, and coaching teams for engagement and performance. Additionally, first time and front line leaders are offered a Leadership Essentials program that cultivates effective communication, coaching, and the engagement and retention of talent. ADM prides itself in offering equitable career opportunities that include global assignments for its high potential talent, internal career growth for those who wish to learn more, and experiential learning through projects, mentorships, and on-the-job development. Board Diversity The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has worked hard to recommend nominees who have skills and experiences relevant to ADMs strategy and operations and who reflect the diversity of the world around us. As of December 31, 2023, 64% of ADMs 11 board members identify as members of underrepresented groups  five are African-American, Hispanic or Asian, and four are women. Workplace Safety ADM is committed to providing a safe working environment for all of its employees and contractors. For the last several years, the Company has been working to significantly reduce its incident rate by strengthening its safety culture and systems so everyone will go home safely to their families and the things that are most important to them. In 2023, about 76% of ADMs sites completed the year without recordable injuries and about 90% without lost workday injuries. The Companys Total Recor

=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

ate and Lost Workday Incident Rate for ADM colleagues (excluding unsupervised contractors) were 0.68 and 0.23, respectively. 16 Item 1. BUSINESS (Continued) In 2023, the Company had two ADM colleague fatalities and 12 serious injuries. The Company continues to take steps to further enhance the safety of its workplaces through occupational safety and process safety improvements and maintains a goal of zero fatalities. Through the guidance of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Technology Center, the operations teams focused on three programs to reduce the most serious injuries:  Safe Work Permit and Last Minute Risk Assessment Standards;  Gloves Clock-to-Clock Program;  New Site Integration Process; and  Loss Prevention Principles Through continued application of these programs, ADM aims to continue to reduce its recordable injury rate in 2024 versus 2023 .

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

 The risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered. Any one or more of such risks could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price and could cause actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company. Operational Risks The Company is exposed to potential business disruption which could adversely affect the Companys operating results. The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to unplanned downtime or extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, raw material shortages, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, or other unexpected outages. ADM is committed to resiliency but these efforts may not resolve emergencies timely or effectively, and the associated liability which could result from these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability in

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Companys operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services, the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Companys facilities and impair the Companys ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner. The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively. In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Companys processing operations, are not available, the Companys business could be disrupted. Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Companys processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results. Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Companys control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, high or low river water conditions, economic conditions, border closures, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions. Transportation, inflationary impacts, and fluctuations in energy prices could affect the Companys operating results. The Companys operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices, inflationary pressures, and certain logistic constraints. The Companys processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal. The Companys transportation operations are partially dependent upon rail access, diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Significant increases in the cost or access of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Companys production costs and operating results. The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce associated impacts and its energy intensity globally to meet its demand while mitigating the effects of climate change. Human capital availability may not be sufficient to effectively support global operations. ADMs global operations function with trained individuals necessary for the processing, warehousing, and shipping of raw materials for products used in other areas of manufacturing or sold as inputs or products to third-party customers. The availability of skilled trade and production workers has been a specific focus for the United States manufacturing industry. The Company has various methods and tactics to mitigate potential shortfalls. The inability to properly staff manufacturing facilities with skilled trades and hourly labor due to a limited number of qualified resources could negatively impact operations. The Company may fail to realize the benefits of or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy. As the Company executes its growth strategy, through both organic and inorganic growth, it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and delayed synergies. Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic, political, and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy. Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms, inability to retain/hire strategic talent, or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives. Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. Due diligence performed prior to an acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Companys reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits. Additionally, acquisitions may involve integration risks such as: internal control effectiveness, system integration risks, the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, ability to retain acquired employees, and other unanticipated risks. The Company may fail to realize the operational or financial benefits expected from acquisitions, which may impact the Compa

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

18 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures and may not be able to monetize the investments at an attractive value when the Company decides to exit the investments. The Company has $5.5 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to governance and management activities. Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $7.0 billion. Risks related to these investments may include: the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investments activities; the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partners; and the risk that the Company may not realize the operational or financial benefits expected from the investment. The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues, financial results, or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments. The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related to joint venture formation, governance (including board of directors representation), merger and acquisition integration management, and harmonization of joint venture policies with the Companys policies and controls. The Company faces risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks. The Company could be materially impacted in the future if a more severe variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) or other disease would arise causing disruptions far more severe than previously experienced. In such circumstances, ADM may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations, critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected, and costs and working capital needs may increase. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, demand for certain products that ADM produces, particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted from a prolonged regional or global outbreak, leading to government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other restrictions. Geopolitical Risks The Company faces risks related to international conflicts, acts of terrorism or war, or other geopolitical events, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, Israel-Hamas war, sanctions, and other economic disruptions. ADMs assets and operations could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism (e.g. purposeful adulteration of the Companys products), and war. The assets and operations located in the region affected by the war in Ukraine are at an increased risk to property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. The Black Sea region is a major exporter of wheat and corn to the world, and the disruption of supply may continue to cause volatility in volumes, prices, and margins of these commodities and related products. While the Company has a robust trade sanctions compliance program, there is a risk that ADM and its related parties could trade with a sanctioned partner due to the number of sanctions taken against Russia. Trade receivables may be at risk of higher defaults, and other third-party risks could affect ADMs ability to obtain inputs if suppliers are unable to perform or face insolvency, as certain supplies may not be attainable due to sanctions and/or restrictions on cross-border payment transactions. The Company could be materially impacted if, in the worst-case scenario, the conflict in Ukraine advances to other countries. Though currently limited, the risk to ADMs business from the war in Israel could increase if it expands into other countries. In such circumstances, trade policies and the Companys critical global supply chain and logistical networks could be affected, impairing the Companys ability to satisfy contractual obligations and impacting working capital requirements. Insurance may not adequately cover these risks. In addition, provisions for certain products that ADM produces, particularly those that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted. The Company continues to monitor risks associated to the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel along with the Red Sea and other political tensions and evaluate alternatives to re

hese risks. 19 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Political instability and changes in trade policies could negatively impact the Companys financial results. The Companys operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to: changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Companys ability to transact business in these markets. The Company has historically benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world. Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world could negatively impact the Companys ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets. Investigation Risks The Investigation and related events could have a material adverse impact on the Company. As previously disclosed, the Company received a voluntary document request from the SEC relating to intersegment sales between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. The Company has historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified certain intersegment sales that occurred between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. As a result of the Investigation, the Company has become subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  the Companys Board of Directors and senior management have been required to devote significant time to the Investigation, the correction of certain segment-specific historical financial information and related matters, resulting in potential management distraction from the operation of the business;  the price of the Companys common stock has declined significantly, has been subject to fluctuations and could continue to fluctuate upon further announcements or actions;  the Company is facing securities litigation and could face additional litigation under federal and state securities laws or other claims arising from the Investigation, such litigation can be costly to defend, and if decided against the Company, such litigation could require the Company to pay substantial judgments or settlements;  the Company could discover additional material or immaterial errors in its financial statements; and  two of the Companys credit ratings have been placed On Credit Watch and Ratings Under Review, and if the ratings are effectively downgraded, the Companys access to the credit markets and its ability to fund its working capital and capital expenditures may be affected. Each of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, although the Company has taken certain actions in response to the findings of the Investigation, the Company could take new or different actions in addition to those taken to date if it determines those actions are appropriate. Such actions are uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys

ce of its common stock. 20 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company is subject to ongoing government investigations, and the timing for their resolution and outcome cannot be predicted. In addition to the SECs voluntary document request described above, following the Companys January 21, 2024 announcement of the Investigation, the Company received voluntary document requests from the DOJ focused primarily on the same subject matter, and the DOJ directed grand jury subpoenas to certain current and former Company employees. The Company cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict the results of these investigations. Expenses incurred in connection with these investigations (which include substantial fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who are parties to these investigations) could adversely affect the Companys liquidity position. The Company may be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct or be subject to other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These government investigations may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain, and/or increase the cost of obtaining, directors and officers liability insurance and/or other types of insurance. In addition, the findings and outcomes of the Investigation as well as the government investigations could result in additional litigation or actions taken by third parties against the Company. The effects and results of such other litigation or actions may have a materially adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Company identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which could impact the Companys ability to report its results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to its accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts not approximating market. For a description of this material weakness, see Controls and Procedures in Part II, Item 9A herein. While the Company has developed a remediation plan, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the material weakness until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new controls. The material weakness, if not fully addressed, could result in additional accounting errors, such as those resulting in the correction of certain segment-specific historical financial information as discussed under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 herein and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. The Company may be unable to remediate this material weakness in a timely manner, which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of future reports and filings the Company makes with the SEC. Negative publicity may adversely affect the Company and the market price of its common stock . The Company has become subject to negative publicity as a result of the Investigation and related events. Negative publicity and unfavorable perception of the Company could have caused and could cause significant declines in the price of the Companys common stock. Negative publicity could also impact the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to continue to do business with the Company and could affect the Companys financial performance or financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or unfavorable perceptions could make it more difficult for the Company and its employees to operate, resulting in reduced morale, a potential increase in employee turnover, and difficulty attracting talent. As a result, any negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on the Com

e market price of its common stock. 21 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Environmental, Social, and Governance Risks The Company may be impacted by carbon emission regulations in multiple regions throughout the globe. The production of the Companys products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including GHG emissions. Such regulated emissions also include indirect emissions that occur in the value chain as the result of activities from assets now owned or controlled by the Company. A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions impacting climate change and rising sea levels including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. In particular, the State of Illinois enacted legislation intended to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 which includes the mandate for zero emissions for private coal by 2030. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment. Operations could be impacted by the European Union (EU) deforestation-free regulation as part of the EU Green Deal. The EU deforestation-free regulation was approved late 2022 and is effective December 2024. The regulation affects seven specific commodities (i.e. cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil, wood, rubber, and cattle) and their derivatives, as well as products made using these commodities (e.g. leather, cosmetics, chocolate, etc.). Soybean is the primary commodity that could be impacted due to the volume of export into and used in production in the EU. Failure to comply with the regulation could have serious consequences including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties, as well as negative impact on the Companys reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations. Food or feed risks derived from quality issues or off label product usage, occupational health and safety issues, and ineffective diversification programs may expose the Company to certain regulatory or reputational risks. The Company is subject to federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable and sustainable farming practices; environmental, health, and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company. Risks to the Companys reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability, food safety, occupational health and safety, workforce diversity, and environmental matters. The Company is continuing to further diversity throughout the organization and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Companys products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition, the Company conforms to management systems, such as the International Organization for Standardization or other recognized global standards. The Companys sustainable practices require oversight and robust monitoring requirements. The lack of unified reporting standards increases sustainability regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. The Company has programs and policies in place (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Program; Commitment to Protecting Forests, Biodiversity and Communities; Environmental Policy; Strive 35 environmental goals; etc.) to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the Company. Starting in 2026, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require companies within the European Union to report extensive climate-related information for the 2025 financial year. The reporting requirements of CSRD, along with the growing multitude of corporate sustainability reporting standards, will result in increased compliance costs and could result in regulatory reporting risks as each standard will have its own required disclosures. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the C

usiness, cash flows, and results of operations. 22 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Financial Risks Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Companys operating results due to its capital-intensive nature. The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy. The Companys working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly. The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Companys business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. Access to credit markets and pricing of the Companys capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies. Strong credit ratings allow the Company to access cost-competitive tier one commercial paper markets. As of December 31, 2023, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the Companys credit ratings at investment grade levels. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Companys ratings were placed On Credit Watch and Ratings Under Review by two of the credit rating agencies. Further watches, reviews or downgrades could occur. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Companys current operations and its growth opportunities. The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics, cash forecasting, and routine communications with credit rating agencies regarding risk management practices and diversifying sources of liquidity. Strategic and Economic Risks Agricultural commodities, agricultural commodity products, and non-agricultural commodity raw materials the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by various factors beyond the Companys control. The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations, including impacts from factors outside the Companys control such as changes in market conditions, weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, climate change, competition, and changes in global demand, which could adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company uses a global network of procurement, processing, and transportation assets, as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams, to continually assess price and basis opportunities. Management-established limits (including a corporate wide value-at-risk metric), with robust internal reporting, help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance. Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities. Reduced supply of agricultural commodities and rising costs of non-agricultural commodity raw materials could adversely affect the Companys profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Companys ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities and products in an efficient manner. High and volatile commodity and non-agricultural commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding. Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished. This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities. The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content. Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers. A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Companys ethanol and biodiesel. The Company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energy-based products in order to protect itself in the near

rice trends and to protect and maximize processing margins. 23 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 63% of the Companys long-lived assets are located in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, and Brazil) and emerging market areas. One of the Companys strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model, which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Companys products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Companys suppliers, customers, and other counterparties. In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, epidemic outbreaks and economic recovery, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows, local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability. Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets, potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, increased risks of corruption, etc. Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Companys operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, although the nature of many of the Companys products (i.e. food and feed ingredients) is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycle. The Company mitigates this risk in many ways, including country risk and exposure analysis, government relations and tax compliance activities, and robust ethics compliance training requirements. The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates and is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors, who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates. The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent. Competition impacts the Companys ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors: Pricing of the Companys products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises. To compete effectively, the Company focuses on safely improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market presence, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, supporting socially responsible and sustainable practices, promoting environmental responsibility, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions. The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which include, but are not limited to: launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the Companys production; shifting consumer preferences; and product safety and quality. In the case of the Nutrition business, while maintaining efficient and cost-effective operations are important, the ability to drive innovation and develop quality nutritional and wellness solutions for human and animal needs are key factors to remain competitive in the nutrition market. Certain of the Companys merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed. The Company is subject to risks associated with economic, product quality, feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry, for example African swine fever, which could adversely affect demand for the Companys products used as ingredients in feed. In addition, ADMs increased investment in the flavors and ingredients businesses exposes the Company to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the Compa

mpany continually assesses opportunities and demand in various regions. 24 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Companys risk management strategies may not be effective. The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Companys strategies for mitigating those risks. The Companys business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets. The Company monitors position limits, counterparty risks, and liquidity levels, and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks. The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process. The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring, limit approvals, and executes training on trade compliance, commodity regulatory reporting controls, and other policies. The Companys risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure. If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Companys exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Companys operating results. Regulatory Risks The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Companys operating results and forward strategy. The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 190 countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in numerous areas including: accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, privacy and security, environmental, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances. The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing, amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which ADM operates may enact changes to their tax rules. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD), the European Union, and other countries (including countries in which the Company operates) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECDs Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024. ADM will continually monitor potential and enacted tax changes, including the implementation of Pillar Two legislation, in the countries in which the Company operates. The impact of these potential new rules, as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations, could have a material effect on ADMs effective tax rate. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

sgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation. 25 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) Regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; and taxation polices could adversely affect the Companys operating results. Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates. These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Companys products; and industry profitability. For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including, but not limited to, changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, including the treatment of small refinery exemptions, can have an impact on the Companys operating results. International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Companys futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Companys products; adversely affect the Companys ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Companys ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results. The Companys strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, expanding its value-added product portfolio, and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in. Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Companys ability to execute this strategy successfully. Technological Risks Information technology (IT) systems are subject to interruptions or failures which may affect the Companys ability to conduct its business. The Companys operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting financial results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. Additionally, legacy technologies are used to support significant business functions. The instability of aging legacy systems could diminish performance and elevate the risk of system failures, reduce compatibility with modern software, and impact growth initiatives. The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and integrating it with various third party service providers on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. The new E

te the instability of aging legacy systems as the Company transitions to the new 1ADM platform. 26 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Companys IT systems, processes, and sites may suffer cyber security breaches, which could expose the Company to operational and various regulatory risks. Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Companys IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Companys third party data. The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation. The Company has put in place security measures to endeavor to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and has instituted control procedures for cybersecurity incident response plans for its critical systems. In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Companys data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors. However, if the Companys IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Companys recovery efforts do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Companys revenues, operating results, and financial condition. Generative AI advancements are progressing at an unprecedented pace, which brings risks that could subject the Company to loss through various technical, legal, and opportunistic-related risks. The pace of Generative AI and the complex and dynamic regulatory environment subjects the Company to a variety of risks including, but not limited to, data privacy and security vulnerabilities, unauthorized third-party usage of Company data associated with training models, malicious use and advanced deceitful communication methods, missed innovation opportunities, and potential competitive disadvantages. Guidance for awareness and responsible Generative AI use to protect ADM data from a legal and ethical standpoint, along with technological development for opportunistic uses, monitoring, and oversight are important components of the Companys risk mitigation approach. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS The Company has no unresolved staff comments. Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY The Company faces significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems ADM must defend against cybersecurity attacks such as exploitation of vulnerabilities, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain attacks, or other similar threats; the attractiveness of the Companys systems and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on ADM or its customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to the Company and its customers in case of a material cybersecurity incident; and ADMs use of third-party products, services and components. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably anticipated to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Nevertheless, the Company recognizes cybersecurity threats are ongoing and evolving. For more information on the Company's cybersecurity risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. ADM is committed to supporting the governance and oversight of cybersecurity risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help the Company assess, identify, and manage these risks. Cybersecurity risks are included in the risk universe that the Companys ERM function evaluates, with input from information security subject matter experts at the Company, to assess top risks to the enterprise. The ERM process provides input into our strategic planning process, such as development of action plans to address and mitigate identified risks. Integrating cybersecurity risk into the overall ERM process in this manner assists the Company in identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks. 27 Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY (Continued) The Company has a dedicated cybersecurity team that collaborates with compliance, privacy, legal, and other teams across the global organization to assess the risk landscape. ADMs cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed regularly by independent third-party auditors. The multifaceted nature of the Companys cybersecurity measures includes aspects of prevention, detection, and response capabilities, employee training programs, threat intelligence monitoring, and the implementation of an array of technologies. The Company has established processes to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, which include the completion of due diligence before engaging with any third party, controls for response to mitigate any significant risks, and assessments and reviews during the course of the relationship. Additionally, the Company has ongoing partnerships with government and commercial cybersecurity experts to understand emerging cybersecurity threats. The Company has seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication. ADM seeks to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against its network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to the Companys internal processes and tools; however, ADM remains potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. The Companys cyber incident response plan includes an escalation process if a cybersecurity incident meets specific rating criteria to trigger swift and effective action designed to minimize potential disruptions and protect the integrity of our operations. The Company also conducts periodic cybersecurity scenarios with senior management to enhance preparedness. The Board of Directors has oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of the ERM program. The Board of Directors is assisted by the Audit Committee, which regularly reviews the cybersecurity program with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. In recent years, the Board added a director who had served as Chief Information Officer for a large public company with sensitive information to assist the Board and Audit Committee in overseeing cybersecurity risks. The Companys cybersecurity program is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to the Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications in Information Systems Security or Information Security Management, and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party audits. Additionally, the CISO directs the Global Information and Cyber Security Council (the Council), which includes a diverse range of relevant experts. The Council includes management from global technology, compliance, privacy, controlling, operations, security, automation, ERM, and internal audit. The Council promotes alignment and communication of new and ongoing cybersecurity prevention techniques and provides a forum for staying current on the latest cybersecurity threats. The CISO and CTO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. The CISO has served in that position since 2018 and, was previously the Vice President, Head of Enterprise Security, Americas at Worldpay and a Security Principal/Strategist for Hewlett Packard Enterprises for a combined cybersecurity experience of 20 years. The CTO joined ADM in 2016 and was previously Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Dow Corning Corporation for approximately 6 years. Item 2. PROPERTIES The Companys operations are such that most products are efficiently processed near the source of raw materials. Consequently, the Company has many plants strategically located in agricultural commodity producing areas. The annual volume of commodities processed will vary depending upon availability of raw materials and demand for finished products. The Company also owns approximately 160 warehouses and terminals primarily used as bulk storage facilities and has 67 innovation centers.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution. The outcomes of these matters are not within the Companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.

. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Performance Indicators The Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues. The Companys Carbohydrate Solutions operations and Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses. The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Companys business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar. The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, gross margins, constant currency revenue and operating profit, segment operating profit, adjusted segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, manufacturing expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses, return on invested capital, economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. The Companys financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Intersegment Sales Background As previously disclosed, the Company received a voluntary document request from the SEC relating to intersegment sales between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. In response, the Company engaged external counsel, assisted by a forensic accounting firm, to conduct an internal investigation, overseen by the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, which is separately advised by external counsel (the Investigation). As previously disclosed on January 21, 2024, the Company placed Vikram Luthar, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, on administrative leave. Correction of Certain Segment-Specific Historical Financial Information Based on the Investigation, the Company is correcting certain segment-specific historical financial information for the years ended December 31, 2021 through 2023 to reflect immaterial error corrections to certain intersegment sales as further described and set forth in Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Par

n. 34 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Company has historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified certain intersegment sales that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The immaterial error corrections generally arise from the measurement of intersegment sales pricing or rebates relating to products sold to the Nutrition reporting segment by the Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. Because each sale to be adjusted occurred between the Companys reporting segments, the adjustments have no impact on the Companys consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), or cash flows. The Company determined that the adjustments are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. For more information, see Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. In addition, because the Investigation covers the period between January 2018 and September 2023, the Company is providing below information with respect to the adjustments effected to operating profit for each of the Companys reporting segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2023. Impact of the Adjustments on Ag Services and Oilseeds Segment on Segment Operating Profit Years Ended December 31 (In millions) 2023 (1) 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Segment operating profit, as originally reported for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018 $ 4,066 $ 4,386 $ 2,775 $ 2,105 $ 1,935 $ 2,020 Adjustments 1 15 24 1 1  Segment operating profit, as revised $ 4,067 $ 4,401 $ 2,799 $ 2,106 $ 1,936 $ 2,020 (1) The adjustments set forth in the tables above for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect adjustments effected for the period January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023. Given the timing of the Investigation, no adjustments were effected in the fourth quarter of 2023. Impact of the Adjustments on Carbohydrate Solutions Segment Operating Profit Years Ended December 31 (In millions) 2023 (1) 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Segment operating profit, as originally reported for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018 $ 1,345 $ 1,360 $ 1,283 $ 717 $ 644 $ 945 Adjustments 30 53 35 15 26 27 Segment operating profit, as revised $ 1,375 $ 1,413 $ 1,318 $ 732 $ 670 $ 972 (1) The adjustments set forth in the tables above for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect adjustments effected for the period January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023.

arter of 2023. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As further described in Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein, the Company also corrected certain immaterial errors relating to the classification of certain intrasegment revenues. More information about such error correction is set forth in Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information. Material Weakness In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to its accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts not approximating market. The Company has put in place a plan to remediate this material weakness. For more information, see Controls and Procedures in Part II, Item 9A herein. Government Investigations The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC. Following the Companys January 21, 2024 announcement of the Investigation, the Company received voluntary document requests from the Department of Justice (DOJ) focused primarily on the same subject matter, and the DOJ directed grand jury subpoenas to certain current and former Company employees. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ. The foregoing is a summary of the Investigation and related matters. The Company could take new or different actions in addition to those taken to date if it determines those actions are appropriate. Operations in Ukraine and Russia ADM employs approximately 630 people in Ukraine and operates an oilseeds crushing plant, a grain port terminal, inland and river silos, and a trading office. The Companys footprint in Russia is limited to operations related to the production and transport of essential food commodities and ingredients. While the Companys Ukraine and Russian operations have historically represented 0.1% of consolidated revenues, the direct and indirect impacts of the ongoing military action could negatively affect ADMs future operating results. The conflict in Ukraine has created disruptions in global supply chains and has created dislocations of key agricultural commodities. The indirect impact of these dislocations on the Companys operating results will be a function of a number of variables including supply and demand responses from the rest of the world as well as the length of the conflict and the condition of the agricultural industry and export infrastructure after the conflict ends. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement that allowed Ukraine to export grain and other food products, expired on July 17, 2023. In September 2023, a new alternative shipping corridor in the Black Sea took effect with Ukraine setting up temporary routes from ports in Greater Odessa. For more information, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. As of December 31, 2023, ADMs assets in Ukraine consisted primarily of current assets that were less than 1% of the Companys total current assets and an immaterial amount of non-current assets. Of the total current assets in Ukraine, the majority were related to inventories that represe

of ADMs total inventories. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, supply has been impacted by market dislocations driven by geopolitical uncertainty, record Brazil soybean production, and extreme drought conditions in Argentina. Inflationary pressures impacted the entire value chain. Crushing was positively impacted by sustainable biofuel demand and protein consumption around the globe. In Refined Products and Other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and elevated oil prices that were supported by biofuels demand, driven by favorable blend economics as historically low distillate fuel oil inventory drove diesel prices to all-time highs. Mediocre growth in mandated renewable volume obligations for 2023 to 2025 drove further market volatility. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with stronger overall margins due to specialty products pricing. Lower gasoline prices in 2023 were supportive of higher domestic gasoline consumption and ethanol demand. Strong ethanol exports helped balance overall supply and demand and were supported by discretionary blending at export markets. In Nutrition, demand was softer in a few food and beverage product categories. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation which drove lower demand especially in higher priced product categories in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement segment and impacted volumes in flavors, flavor systems, emulsifiers, bioactives, and alternative proteins. In Animal Nutrition, overall market remained weak with pressured farm gate prices in China and structurally decreasing European production. Certain tailwinds, however, including softening raw material prices, predominantly in micro ingredients, and recovery in global poultry production helped offset the negative impacts. The amino acids market continued to be subdued with ample supply from China. Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased 20% or $0.9 billion, to $3.5 billion. Segment operating profit decreased 10% or $0.6 billion, to $5.9 billion, and included a net charge of $344 million consisting of asset impairment and restructuring charges and net settlement contingencies totaling $361 million and a gain on the sale of certain assets of $17 million. Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of $100 million consisting of charges totaling $147 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and contingencies/settlements, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $47 million. Adjusted segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) decreased $0.4 billion to $6.2 billion due primarily to lower results in Crushing, Wilmar, Nutrition, Ag Services, and Starches and Sweeteners, partially offset by higher results in Refined Products and Other, Other Business, and Vantage Corn Processors. Lower margins partially offset by improved pricing and positive timing impacts, overall decline in volume, higher manufacturing costs, and unplanned downtime at Decatur East decreased adjusted segment operating profit. Corporate results in the current year were a net charge of $1.6 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $6 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and restructuring charges of $6 million. Corporate results in the prior year were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $9 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Income taxes of $828 million decreased $40 million. The Companys effective tax rate for 2023 was 19.3% compared to 16.6% for 2022 . The change in the rate was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings. Analysis of Statements of Earnings Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in metric tons): (In thousands) 2023 2022 Change Oilseeds 34,899 32,952 1,947 Corn 18,067 18,558 (491) Total 52,966 51,510 1,456 The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush rates in the current year compared to decreased crush rates in the prior year resulting from the decline in global demand for rapeseed and the decline in canola crop due to the drought condition in North America. The overall decrease in corn processed volumes was related to unplanned downtime from plants in Decatur, Illinois and due to the earthquak

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: (In millions) 2023 2022 Change Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services $ 47,420 $ 53,181 $ (5,761) Crushing 14,020 13,139 881 Refined Products and Other 11,986 13,243 (1,257) Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 73,426 79,563 (6,137) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 9,885 10,251 (366) Vantage Corn Processors 2,989 3,710 (721) Total Carbohydrate Solutions 12,874 13,961 (1,087) Nutrition Human Nutrition 3,634 3,769 (135) Animal Nutrition 3,577 3,867 (290) Total Nutrition 7,211 7,636 (425) Other Business 424 396 28 Total Other Business 424 396 28 Total $ 93,935 $ 101,556 $ (7,621) Revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. Revenues decreased $7.6 billion to $93.9 billion due to lower sales prices ($10.3 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($2.7 billion). Lower sales prices of oils, soybeans, corn, biodiesel, and farming materials and lower sales volumes of corn, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of soybeans and biodiesel. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 8% to $73.4 billion due to lower sales prices ($10.1 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($4.0 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 8% to $12.9 billion due to lower sales prices ($0.6 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.5 billion). Nutrition revenues decreased 6% to $7.2 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.8 billion), partially offset by higher sales prices ($0.4 billion). Cost of products sold decreased $7.6 billion to $86.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher volumes and increased manufacturing expenses. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.3 billion due to individually insignificant increases in various expense categories. Foreign currency translation impacts increased revenues by $0.1 billion and cost of goods sold by $0.1 billion with no impact to gross profit. Gross profit decreased $0.1 billion or 1%, to $7.5 billion due to lower results in Crushing ($273 million), Nutrition ($232 million) and Ag Services ($68 million), partially offset by higher results in Refined Products and Other ($431 million) and Carbohydrate Solutions ($46 million).

he segment operating profit discussion on page 41. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 3% to $3.5 billion due principally to higher salaries and benefit costs, increased expenses for contracted outside labor, and higher professional and financing fees, partially offset by lower provisions for bad debt. Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $276 million to $342 million. Charges in the current year consisted of $137 million of impairments related to goodwill in the Animal Nutrition reporting unit, $108 million of impairments related to property, plant, and equipment and an equity method investment, $64 million of impairments related to customer list and discontinued Animal Nutrition trademarks, and $27 million of restructuring, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $6 million of restructuring in Corporate. Charges in the prior year consisted of $37 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and $28 million of restructuring, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $1 million of restructuring in Corporate. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $281 million to $551 million due primarily to lower earnings from the Companys investments in Wilmar, Skyland Grain, LLC, and Hungrana Ltd., partially offset by higher earnings from ADMs investment in Olenex. Interest and investment income increased $206 million to $499 million due primarily to higher interest rates, partially offset by revaluation losses of $76 million compared to revaluation gains of $37 million in the prior year. Interest expense increased $251 million to $647 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on customer deposit balances in ADM Investor Services and on the Companys commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense from a new debt issuance at a higher rate. Interest expense in the current year also included a $6 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020 compared to a $9 million mark-to-market gain adjustment in the prior year. Other income - net of $176 million decreased $182 million. Current year income included net gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $38 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million, net foreign exchange gains of $85 million, and net other income. Prior year income included a legal recovery of $110 million related to the 2020 and 2019 closure of the Companys export facility in Reserve, Louisiana, net foreign exchange gains of $105 million, a $50 million payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program, gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business of $78 million, and the non-service components of n

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ag Services and Oilseeds operating profit decreased 8%. In Ag Services, significantly higher origination volumes and margins in South America due to a record Brazilian soybean crop were mostly offset by decreased North American origination results from lower export demand and low water levels. Destination marketing, global ocean freight, and transportation results decreased due to less favorable timing effects and higher freight rates. Current year results also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida compared to the prior year's $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Companys Reserve, Louisiana, export facility. In Crushing, global crush margins were historically strong, yet lower than the prior years record highs with the lower Argentine soybean crop driving a tight soybean meal supply, partially offset by improved processed volumes. In EMEA, lower meal demand and exports were offset by the switch capacity in the region. In Refined Products and Other, increasing global demand for fuel and food created elevated margins in North America and Europe for refined oils and biodiesel. In North America, sales volumes were also higher supported by U.S. renewable volume obligations and margins for food oil in Europe expanding year-over-year. Additionally, net positive mark-to-market timing effects that are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods contributed to the results in the current year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year. Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit decreased 3%. Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from the wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the year. North America starches and sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior year with higher margins led by specialty products. Ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated, though lower relative to the prior year. Results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of the corn germ plants. In EMEA, the business effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted higher margins driven by solid customer demand. Vantage Corn Processors results were higher as the business executed on a robust demand and margin environment for ethanol partially offset by the absence of the prior years $50 million payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program. Nutrition operating profit decreased 36%. Human Nutrition results were lower than the prior year, as the business continued to manage demand fulfillment challenges and destocking in certain categories. Flavors results were lower than the prior year driven by softer sales, higher expenses, and $45 million of negative impacts primarily related to the deconsolidation and write-down of a joint venture. Specialty Ingredients results were lower year-over-year due to continued lower market demand for plant-based proteins in meat alternatives and unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Health and Wellness results were lower than the prior year due to a revaluation loss of $19 million related to an investment in precision fermentation, partially offset by continued growth in the biotics category. Animal Nutrition results were lower compared to the prior year due to lower contribution from amino acids, pockets of softer global feed demand affecting volumes, and continued supply chain challenges and inventory losses in pet solutions. Other Business operating profit increased 125%. Higher interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services. Captive insurance results improved on premiums from new programs, partially offset by increased claim settlements.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corporate results were a net charge of $1.6 billion in the current year compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Interest expense-net increased $98 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on the Companys commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense from a new debt issuance at a higher rate. Unallocated corporate costs increased $118 million due primarily to higher financing, information technology, and centers of excellence costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense accruals and higher corporate cost allocation. Gain on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Other income in the current year included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by investment revaluation losses of $57 million and railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. Other income in the prior year included investment revaluation gains of $37 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Companys financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items. Management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Companys performance because they provide investors additional information about the Companys operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted EPS, net earnings, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, strong global demand continued due to a short crop in South America. The conflict in Ukraine resulted in even tighter global stocks of commodities and created high volatility, which had a positive impact on North and South American origination prices. Global Trade results were driven by market disconnects, tight supply, strong destination marketing margins, and firm ocean freight rates. North American origination was negatively impacted by weather-related supply disruption and delayed planting and lower river levels. Crushing margins continued to benefit from strong protein and renewable diesel demand and tight oilseeds stocks. In Refined Products and Other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and tight supply with volatile energy markets driving up biodiesel margins. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners was solid with margins remaining steady despite higher input costs. Ethanol demand for domestic gasoline was lower, in part due to high gas prices, while export demand remained strong, driven by favorable blending economics and government incentives. Corn milling margins benefited from strong co-product results, as prices for oil and feed products rose in line with higher underlying corn prices. Corn costs were volatile and higher, in part due to a relatively low projected corn stocks-to-use ratio and uncertainty caused by the conflict in Ukraine. Nutrition benefited from overall strong demand in various food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Human Nutrition, demand for flavors, flavor systems, specialty proteins, bioactives, and fibers was strong, but higher energy, transportation, and raw material costs, and a strong U.S. dollar adversely impacted results. In Animal Nutrition, amino acids pricing and margins improved due to a tighter global supply environment but the devaluation of certain currencies, a bird flu outbreak, and weak demand in other product lines, with some premix and additives customers cutting products out of formulation due to increased ingredient, freight, and energy costs, adversely impacted results. Increased competition in Brazil also contributed to the weak demand in that country. ADMs productivity initiatives are improving the Companys capabilities to help mitigate the impact of inflation. Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 60% or $1.6 billion, to $4.3 billion. Segment operating profit increased 41% or $1.9 billion, to $6.5 billion, and included a net charge of $100 million consisting of charges totaling $147 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and contingencies/settlements, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $47 million. Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of $136 million consisting of charges totaling $213 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and settlement, partially offset by gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets of $77 million. Adjusted segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) increased $1.9 billion to $6.6 billion due primarily to higher results in most businesses except in Vantage Corn Processors. Corporate results in 2022 were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $9 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Corporate results in 2021 were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a pension settlement charge of $83 million, loss on debt extinguishment of $36 million, a mark-to-market gain of $19 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and a restructuring charge of $4 million. Income taxes of $868 million increased $290 million. The Companys effective tax rate for 2022 was 16.6% compared to 17.4% for 2021 . The change in the rate was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the impact of discrete tax items.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall decrease in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to decreased crush rates resulting from the decline in seeds availability, a temporarily idled facility in Paraguay due to crop failure, weather-related challenges, and the indefinite shutdown of a Ukraine facility since February 2022. The overall decrease in corn processed volumes was primarily related to reduced volumes of fuel alcohol due to market conditions, the sale of the Peoria, Illinois facility in November 2021, and logistical challenges surrounding railcar availability since the second quarter of 2022. Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: (In millions) 2022 2021 Change Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services $ 53,181 $ 45,017 $ 8,164 Crushing 13,139 11,368 1,771 Refined Products and Other 13,243 10,662 2,581 Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 79,563 67,047 12,516 Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 10,251 7,611 2,640 Vantage Corn Processors 3,710 3,499 211 Total Carbohydrate Solutions 13,961 11,110 2,851 Nutrition Human Nutrition 3,769 3,189 580 Animal Nutrition 3,867 3,523 344 Total Nutrition 7,636 6,712 924 Other Business 396 380 16 Total Other Business 396 380 16 Total $ 101,556 $ 85,249 $ 16,307 Revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. Revenues increased $16.3 billion to $101.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($17.1 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($0.8 billion). Higher sales prices of corn, wheat, oil, soybean, and meal, and higher sales volumes of rice, flavors, biodiesel, and corn, were partially offset by lower sales prices of rice and flavors, and lower sales volumes of wheat and oil. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues increased 19% to $79.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($14.3 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($1.8 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues increased 26% to $14.0 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.6 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion), despite the loss of USD-grade industrial alcohol volumes from the divested Peoria, Illinois facility. Nutrition revenues increased 14% to $7.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($0.2 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion). Cost of products sold increased $14.7 billion to $94.0 billion due principally to higher average commodity costs and higher manufacturing expenses. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.9 billion t

 principally to higher energy costs, higher maintenance expenses, increased operating supplies, and higher salaries and benefit costs. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Foreign currency translation impacts decreased revenues by $2.6 billion and cost of products sold by $2.4 billion. Gross profit increased $1.6 billion or 26%, to $7.6 billion due to higher results in Ag Services and Oilseeds ($1.3 billion), Starches and Sweeteners ($477 million), and Nutrition ($149 million), partially offset by lower results in Vantage Corn Processors ($352 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 48. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% to $3.4 billion due principally to provisions for bad debt, higher IT and project-related expenses, higher salaries and benefit costs, increased travel expenses, and amortization of intangibles from new acquisitions. Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $98 million to $66 million. Charges in the current year consisted of $37 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and $28 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $1 million of restructuring charges in Corporate. Charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $125 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and $35 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $4 million of restructuring charges in Corporate. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $237 million to $832 million due to higher earnings from the Companys investments in Wilmar and Olenex. Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year of $36 million was related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025. Interest and investment income increased $197 million to $293 million due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by lower revaluation gains of $37 million compared to $49 million in the prior period. Interest expense increased $131 million to $396 million due to higher long-term debt balances and increased short-term rates on the Companys U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs. Interest expense in 2022 also included a $9 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020 compared to a $19 million mark-to-market gain adjustment in 2021. Other income - net of $358 million increased $264 million. Income in 2022 included a legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Companys Reserve, Louisiana, export facility of $110 million, net foreign exchange gains of $105 million, a $50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program, gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, partially offset by other net expense. Income in 2021 included gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, net foreign exchange gains of $24 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $33 million, and other income, partially offset by a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administratio

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ag Services and Oilseeds operating profit increased 57%. Ag Services results were significantly higher versus 2021. Global trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. North American origination volumes were lower but margins were higher year-over-year. South America results were higher, driven by better origination margins on good demand for grain. Crushing was higher year-over-year driven by robust protein and renewable diesel demand. Positive net timing effects in 2022 versus negative timing effects in 2021 helped drive higher year-over-year results. Refined Products and Other results were higher than in 2021, driven by higher margins due to strong oils demand. Biodiesel margins also benefited from direct sales compared to the historical auction sales. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher versus 2021. Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit increased 7%. Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from the wet mills, delivered higher results versus 2021, driven by solid margins across sweeteners and starches, strong contributions from corn co-products, and effective risk management, partially offset by weaker ethanol margins. Sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery and the biosolutions platform continued to deliver revenue growth as demand for plant-based products expanded into more diverse applications. Vantage Corn Processors results were lower versus 2021 as ethanol margins decreased from the 2021 strong positioning gains and industrial alcohol results from the now-sold Peoria, Illinois facility, partially offset by the $50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program. Nutrition operating profit increased 6%. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors results were lower driven by demand fulfillment challenges, the impact of the strong U.S. dollar in EMEA, softer demand in Asia Pacific, and higher costs in North America. Strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contribution from the Sojaprotein acquisition, and good demand for texturants offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. Health and Wellness was also higher year-over-year, powered by probiotics, including the contribution from the November 2021 Deerland Probiotics and Enzymes acquisition, and robust demand for fiber and Vitamin E. Animal Nutrition profits were comparable to 2021. Other Business operating profit increased 568%. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services and improved underwriting performance resulted in better captive insurance results.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corporate results were a net charge of $1.3 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion in 2021. Interest expense-net increased $56 million due primarily to higher long-term debt balances and increased average rates on the Companys U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs. Unallocated corporate costs increased $69 million due primarily to higher IT and project-related costs and higher costs in the Companys centers of excellence, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. Loss on debt extinguishment in 2021 related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025. Gain on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Restructuring and settlement charges in 2021 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Companys ADM Retirement Plan and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees to independent third parties, and individually insignificant restructuring charges. Other income in 2022 included investment revaluation gains of $37 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. Other income in 2021 included investment revaluation gains of $49 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $16 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business. The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADMs control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance ADMs operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs. In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets. Cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion in 2023 compared to $3.5 billion in 2022. Working capital changes decreased cash by $0.3 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $1.5 billion in the prior year. Segregated investments increased $0.2 billion driven by higher interest rates. Trade receivables decreased $0.7 billion due to lower revenues. Inventories decreased $2.9 billion due to lower inventory prices and volumes. Trade payables decreased $1.5 billion due to lower payables related to grain and other inventory purchases. Payables to brokerage customers decreased $2.1 billion due to decreased trading activity in the Companys futures commission and brokerage business. Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion this year compared to $1.4 billion last year. Capital expenditures in the current year were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Proceeds from sales of assets and businesses were $60 million in the current year compared to $131 million in the prior year. There were no additional cost method investments in the current year compared to $0.2 billion in the prior year. Cash used in financing activities was $4.6 billion this year compared to $2.5 billion last year. Long-term debt borrowings in the current year of $0.5 billion consisted of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Notes due 2033. Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year of $0.8 billion consisted of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Notes due 2032. Proceeds from the borrowings in the current year were used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the borrowings in the prior year were used to finance investments and expenditures in eligible green projects that contribute to environmental objectives and/or eligible social projects that aim to address or mitigate a specific social issue and/or seek to achieve positive social outcomes. Long-term debt payments in the current year of $1.0 billion consisted of the 600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% Notes due 2023 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon exchangeable bonds due 2023. Long-term debt payments in the prior year of $0.5 billion consisted of the 0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on March 25, 2021. Net payments on short-term credit arrangements of $0.4 billion in the current year was comparable to $0.4 billion to the prior year. Share repurchases in the current year were $2.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year. Dividends paid in the current year were $1.0 billion compared to $0.9 billion in the prior year. At December 31, 2023, ADM had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1. Included in working capital is $7.0 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. At December 31, 2023, the Companys capital resources included shareholders equity of $24.1 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $13.2 billion, of which $11.5 billion was unused. ADMs ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt of $8.3 billion and shareholders equity of $24.1 billion in 2023 and the sum of long-term debt of $7.7 billion and shareholders equity of $24.3 billion in 2022) was 25% and 24% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company uses this ratio as a measure of ADMs long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility. The Companys ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt of $0.1 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $1 million, and long-term debt of $8.3 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2023 and the sum of short-term debt of $0.5 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $0.9 billion, and long-term debt of $7.7 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2022) to capital (the sum of net debt of $7.0 billion and shareholders equity of $24.1 billion in 2023 and the sum of net debt of $8.1 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.3 billion in 2022) was 22% and 25% at Decemb

22, respectively. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was $5 million commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2023. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Companys historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $6.8 billion, the Company has asserted these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the Programs) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $3.0 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expand the Companys access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2023, the Company utilized $1.6 billion of its facility under the Programs. On November 5, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Companys Board of Directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program. The Company has acquired approximately 148.0 million shares under this program and its extension as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has total available liquidity of $12.9 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit. In 2024, the Company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $1.0 billion in dividends and up to $2.3 billion in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year. The Companys purchase obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $14.0 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in obligations to purchase agricultural commodity inventories, partially offset by an increase in energy commitments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $13.4 billion within the next twelve months. The Companys other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include current maturities of long-term debt of $1 million, interest payments of $0.4 billion, operating lease payments of $0.3 billion, transition tax liability of $49 million, and pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $114 million. The Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $16.8 billion. The Companys credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the Companys credit ratings at investment grade levels. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Companys ratings were placed On Credit Watch and Ratings Under Review by two of the credit rating agencies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies and estimates are considered critical, as these policies and estimates are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on ADMs financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Co

=== ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT ===

pment, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies and estimates. Following are the accounting policies and estimates management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives Description: Certain of the Companys inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are valued at estimated fair values, including $7.0 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.4 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.0 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.3 billion of inventory-related payables. Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Judgments and Uncertainties: Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. The Companys inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.4 billion of assets and $0.6 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price. For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8. Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods could differ materially. Derivatives  Designated Hedging Activities Description: The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month. See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information. Judgments and Uncertainties: Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold. Income Taxes Description: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards which prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur. Judgments and Uncertainties: ADM calculates its provision for income taxes 

=== ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT ===

tory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company uses judgment in evaluating the Companys tax positions and determining its annual tax provision. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: While ADM considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its consolidated financial statements when it is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in the Netherlands challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company. The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information). Business Combinations Description: The Companys acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended. The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings. Judgments and Uncertainties: Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. Goodwill Description: Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. The Company has seven reporting units with goodwill identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 350, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting units fair value. If after completing the qualitative assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired, an estimate of fair value is prepared by the Company. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value, when using a discounted cash flow analysis, of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and discount rates. These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows of the reporting units utilizing appropriate revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and discount rate. A decline in the actual cash flows of the reporting units in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analysis, could result in the carrying value of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Further, a change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their 

=== ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT ===

lues. Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment in five reporting units and using a quantitative assessment in two reporting units. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $137 million related to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit that was evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows (income approach) and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and or anticipated financial metrics (market approach). As a result of this impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was below its carrying value. The decline in the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was primarily driven by a higher discount rate due to changes in the underlying business performance and industry conditions as well as the macroeconomic environment, causing a decline in the projected cash flows. During the first three quarters of 2023, Animal Nutritions business performance and industry conditions gradually declined despite managements ongoing mitigation and efficiency improvement actions. Given Animal Nutritions significant excess in fair value over carrying value in prior years and the ongoing mitigation actions, the Company believed Animal Nutritions fair value was more likely than not greater than its carrying value as of September 30, 2023, and therefore did not conduct a quantitative evaluation of the reporting unit prior to the annual impairment testing on October 1, 2023. However, as these conditions persisted in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company was no longer able to conclude Animal Nutritions fair value more likely than not exceeded carrying value and proceeded to perform the quantitative fair value estimate as described above. Following the recording of the impairment charge, the remaining carrying value of goodwill in the Animal Nutrition reporting unit as of December 31, 2023 was $0.9 billion. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing analysis for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The sensitivities were calculated in isolation using the income approach and keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivities for revenue growth and EBITDA margins do not consider the offsetting impact of a lower discount rate assumption to reflect the reduced risk in estimated future cash flow growth used under the income approach or the related impacts on pricing multiples used under the market approach.  A hypothetical increase to the discount rate of approximately 25 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $65 million;  A hypothetical decrease in the expected annual revenue growth rate over the entire forecast period of approximately 100 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $60 million; and  A hypothetical decrease in the expected EBITDA margins in each year over the entire forecast period of approximately 15 basis points would result in additional goodwill impairment of approximately $60 million. The estimated fair value of the other reporting unit evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment during the year ended December 31, 2023 was in excess of 198% of its carrying value, and therefore no impairment was recorded for that reporting unit. There were goodwill impairment charges of $6 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 and none during the year ended December 31, 2022. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then impairment charges recorded could differ materially. Investments in Affiliates Description: The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 22.5% investment in Wilmar. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. Judgments and Uncertainties: Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee. However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements. The Company also periodically compares the book value of its investment in Wilmar against its market value as determined through quoted market prices, and evaluates any potential other than temporary impairment based on the near-term prospects of Wilmar in relation to the severity and duration of the decline in fair value and the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment in Wilmar. Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: If management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the Company recognizes may differ. If management used different assumptions in the evaluation of its Wilmar investment, then the amount of any impairment charges could differ materially. 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Companys overall short or long commodity position. Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. The Companys commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge anticipated transactions. The fair value of the Companys commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy. The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period. Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly. In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices. The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows: December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 498 $ 50 $ 986 $ 99 Lowest position (6) (1) 44 4 Average position 125 13 388 39 The change in fair value of the average position was due to the overall decrease in average quantities of certain commodities. 56 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) Currencies The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies. These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur. The Company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company changed the functional currency of its Turkish entities to the U.S. dollar which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The amount the Company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $15.5 billion and $13.0 billion ($17.9 billion and $15.5 billion at historical rates) at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of $2.4 billion and the appreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of $0.1 billion. The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion for December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Fair value of long-term debt $ 8,557 $ 7,502 Fair value amount over (under) carrying value 298 (232) Market risk 378 342 The increase in the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2023 is due to a new debt issuance and a decrease in corporate bond interest rates. 57

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business ADM unlocks the power of nature to enrich the quality of life for people and animals. ADMs innovation and expertise are helping people live healthier lives and support a healthier planet. The Companys globally-integrated footprint combined with local insight give ADM capabilities few other companies have to meet critical and global needs. With a foundation in nature and nutrition, the Company is a leader in sustainability, scaling across entire value chains to help decarbonize the industry, and safeguard the planet. ADM has three business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. The Company is an essential global agricultural supply chain manager and processor supporting food security by connecting local needs with global capabilities. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest. For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard. Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. The Companys portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements. In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Companys year-end and are consistent from period to period. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Segregated Cash and Investments The Company segregates certain cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements. These balances represent deposits received from customers of the Companys registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services, cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements. Segregated cash and investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Companys captive insurance business. To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, they are considered restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. 64 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Receivables The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances including any accrued interest receivables thereon. The Company estimates uncollectible accounts by pooling receivables according to type, region, credit risk rating, and age. Each pool is assigned an expected loss co-efficient to arrive at a general reserve based on historical write-offs adjusted, as needed, for regional, economic, and other forward-looking factors. The Company minimizes credit risk due to the large and diversified nature of its worldwide customer base. ADM manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. Long-term receivables recorded in other assets were not material to the Companys overall receivables portfolio. The Company recorded bad debt expense in selling, general, and administrative expenses of $ 6 million, $ 88 million, and $ 32 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Changes to the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 (In millions) Beginning, January 1 $ 199 $ 122 Current year provisions 6 88 Recoveries 2 2 Write-offs against allowance ( 28 ) ( 12 ) Foreign exchange translation adjustment  ( 2 ) Other 36 1 Ending, December 31 $ 215 $ 199 Current year provisions in the year ended December 31, 2023 is net of reversals of prior year general provisions for economic factors related to the pandemic and provision for a certain customer. Write-offs against allowance in the year ended December 31, 2023 were related to a customer in Brazil and allowance on receivables that were subsequently sold in the current year. Other in the year ended December 31, 2023 is due primarily to reclassifications. Inventories Certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value. In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The following table sets forth the Companys inventories as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Raw materials and supplies $ 5,475 $ 6,975 Finished goods 6,482 7,796 Total inventories $ 11,957 $ 14,771 Included in raw materials and supplies are work in process inventories which were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 65 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Fair Value Measurements The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification. Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Based on historical experience with the Companys suppliers and customers, the Companys own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the measurement in Level 3. In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels. The Companys policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period. Derivatives The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The majority of the Companys derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested. 66 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Cost Method Investments Cost method investments of $ 438 million and $ 488 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in Other Assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Revaluation losses of $ 76 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 were related to investments in the alternative protein category and precision fermentation. Revaluation gains of $ 37 million and $ 49 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were in connection with observable third-party transactions (a level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards). Revaluation gains and losses are recorded in interest and investment income in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings. As of December 31, 2023, the cumulative amounts of upward and downward adjustments were $ 113 million and $ 76 million, respectively. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 40 years. The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $ 32 million, $ 20 million, and $ 17 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law. Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general, and administrative expenses. Income tax effects from AOCI are released when the individual units of account are sold, terminated, or extinguished. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Definite-lived intangible assets, including capitalized expenses related to the Companys 1ADM program such as third-party configuration costs and internal labor, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Companys accounting policy is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $ 201 million related to goodwill, customer list, and discontinued animal nutrition trademarks, $ 2 million related to customer list, and $ 52 million related to goodwill and other intangibles during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively (see Note 9 for additional information). 67 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $ 137 million was related to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit that was evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows (income approach) and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and or anticipated financial metrics (market approach). As a result of the impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was below its carrying value. The decline in the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit was primarily driven by a higher discount rate due to changes in the underlying business performance and industry conditions as well as the macroeconomic environment, causing a decline in projected cash flows. Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In addition, assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Companys ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies on managements estimate of market participant assumptions or estimated selling price for assets considered held for sale (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards). During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company temporarily idled certain assets which were not material. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, asset abandonment and impairment charges were $ 108 million, $ 35 million, and $ 73 million, respectively. Payables to Brokerage Customers Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Companys futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances. Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purposes as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties. Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets. Revenues The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Topic 610-20). Stock Compensation The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The Companys stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options. The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively. These valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions. Measured compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award. Research and Development Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred and recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $ 256 million, $ 216 million, and $ 171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 68 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Per Share Data Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method. Business Combinations The Companys acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended . The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings. Operations in Ukraine and Russia ADM employs approximately 630 people in Ukraine and operates an oilseeds crushing plant, a grain port terminal, inland and river silos, and a trading office. The Companys footprint in Russia is limited to operations related to the production and transport of essential food commodities and ingredients. As a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Company reviewed the valuation of its assets and concluded that as of December 31, 2023, receivables, net of allowances, are deemed collectible and market inventories are valued appropriately. The Company also evaluated the impact of Russias announcement of its purported annexation of four Ukrainian regions on the valuation of ADMs assets in those regions and concluded the assets are appropriately valued. As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, the Company will continue to review the valuation of these assets and make any required adjustments, which are not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the amended guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations , which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. The amended guidance requires an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , (Topic 606). The Companys adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 69 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 405-50, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs , which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs. The amended guidance requires an entity (buyer) in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the programs nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. ADM has Supplier Payable Programs (SPP) with financial institutions which act as its paying agents for payables due to certain of its suppliers. The Company has neither an economic interest in a suppliers participation in the SPP nor a direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, and has concluded its obligations to the suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by their participation in the SPP. Accordingly, amounts associated with the SPP continue to be classified in current liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet and in operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program require payment in full generally within 90 days of the invoice date. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's outstanding payment obligations suppliers had elected to sell to the financial institutions were $ 274 million and $ 196 million, respectively. Changes to the outstanding payment obligations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2023 (In millions) Beginning, January 1 $ 196 Obligations confirmed 1,100 Obligations paid ( 1,022 ) Ending, December 31 $ 274 Through December 31, 2024, the Company has the option to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amended guidance do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2024, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The Companys adoption of the amended guidance will not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Effective December 31, 2024, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC 280, Segment Reporting , which improves disclosures about a public entitys reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for more detailed information about a reportable segments expenses. The amended guidance improves reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and permits entities to disclose more than one measure of a reportable segments profitability used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The adoption of the amended guidance will result in expanded disclosures in the Companys segment and geographic information footnote but will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. Effective December 31, 2025, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC 740, Income Taxes , which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The adoption of the amended guidance will result in expanded disclosures in the Companys income taxes footnote but will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 70 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. Revenues Revenue Recognition The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer. The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of the Companys contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606. The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $ 761 million, $ 818 million, and $ 606 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues. Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of products sold. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities relate to advance payments from customers for goods and services the Company has yet to provide. Contract liabilities of $ 626 million and $ 694 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were recorded in accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheet. Revenues recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023 from the December 31, 2022 contract liabilities were $ 469 million. 71 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2.

Revenues (Continued) Ag Services and Oilseeds The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities, from service fees for the transportation of goods, from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities, and from its structured trade finance activities. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract. Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or providing service to a customer. For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606. The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components. For physically settled derivative sales contracts outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20. The Company engages in various structured trade finance activities to leverage its global trade flows whereby the Company obtains letters of credit (LCs) to guarantee payments on both global purchases and sales of grain. LCs guaranteeing payment on grain sales are sold on a non-recourse basis with no continuing involvement. The Company earns returns from the difference in interest rates between the LCs that guarantee payment on the underlying purchases and sales of grain given the differing risk profiles of the underlying transactions. The net return related to structured trade finance activities is included in revenue and is not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Carbohydrate Solutions The Carbohydrate Solutions segment generates revenue from the sale of products manufactured at the Companys global corn and wheat milling facilities around the world. Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer. Products are shipped to customers from the Companys various facilities and from its network of storage terminals. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract. For physically settled derivative sales contracts outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20. Nutrition The Nutrition segment sells ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, edible beans, formula feeds, animal health and nutrition products, pet food and treats, and other specialty food and feed ingredients. Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized follows the contracted price or the mutually agreed price of the product. Freight and shipping are recognized as a component of revenue at the same time control transfers to the customer. Other Business Other Business includes the Companys futures commission business whose primary sources of revenue are commissions and brokerage income generated from executing orders and clearing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on behalf of its customers. Commissions and brokerage revenue are recognized on the date the transaction is executed. Other Business also includes the Companys captive insurance business which generates third party revenue through its proportionate share of premiums from third-party reinsurance pools. Reinsurance premiums are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period underlying the policy. 74 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Acquisitions Fiscal year 2023 acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired Prairie Pulse Inc., an 83 % majority stake in Buckminster Química, and D.C.A. Finance B.V. for an aggregate cash consideration of $ 25 million. The aggregate cash consideration of these acquisitions, net of $ 2 million in cash acquired, was preliminarily allocated as follows: (In millions) Property, plant, and equipment $ 18 Goodwill 20 Other long-term assets 2 Long-term liabilities ( 17 ) Aggregate cash consideration $ 23 Fiscal year 2022 acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired Kansas Protein Foods LLC for cash consideration of $ 23 million. The cash consideration of this acquisition, net of $ 1 million in cash acquired, was allocated as follows: (In millions) Property, plant, and equipment $ 9 Goodwill 13 Cash consideration $ 22 Fiscal year 2021 acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Companys Nutrition segment acquired five businesses including, a 75 % majority stake in U.S.-based PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, The Pound Bakery, and NutraDine (collectively, P4), premier providers of private label pet treats and supplements; Deerland Probiotics & Enzymes (Deerland), a leader in probiotic, prebiotic, and enzyme technology; and Sojaprotein, a leading European provider of non-GMO soy ingredients, for an aggregate consideration of $ 1.6 billion using cash on hand. The aggregate cash consideration of these acquisitions, net of $ 21 million in cash acquired, was allocated as follows. In 2022, the Company made immaterial adjustments to the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions. These adjustments have been reflected in the table below. (In millions) P4 Deerland Sojaprotein Others Total Working capital $ 11 $ 27 $ 35 $ 7 $ 80 Property, plant, and equipment 73 43 85 6 207 Goodwill 317 396 192 35 940 Other intangible assets 245 252 42 18 557 Other long-term assets   12 2 14 Long-term liabilities  ( 74 ) ( 10 )  ( 84 ) Temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 150 )    ( 150 ) Aggregate cash consideration $ 496 $ 644 $ 356 $ 68 $ 1,564 75 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Acquisitions (Continued) The Company has the option to acquire the remaining 25 % interest in P4 from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2025, based on a fixed multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the twelve months prior to the exercise of this option. The noncontrolling interest holders also have the option to put the 25 % interest to the Company on the same terms. The Company records the 25 % remaining interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest. Of the $ 940 million allocated to goodwill, $ 313 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The 2021 acquisitions advance ADMs growth strategy by expanding the Companys capabilities in pet treat and supplements and the fast-growing global demand for plant-based proteins as well as capabilities in the high-value flavor segment and the fast growing demand for food, beverages, and supplements. The post-acquisition financial results of these acquisitions are reported in the Nutrition segment. The following table sets forth the fair values and the useful lives of the other intangible assets acquired.

Fair Value Measurements The following tables set forth, by level, the Companys assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (In millions) Assets: Inventories carried at market $  $ 4,274 $ 2,713 $ 6,987 Unrealized derivative gains: Commodity contracts  628 731 1,359 Foreign exchange contracts  187  187 Cash equivalents 209   209 Segregated investments 1,362   1,362 Total Assets $ 1,571 $ 5,089 $ 3,444 $ 10,104 Liabilities: Unrealized derivative losses: Commodity contracts $  $ 500 $ 457 $ 957 Foreign exchange contracts  144  144 Inventory-related payables  1,219 101 1,320 Total Liabilities $  $ 1,863 $ 558 $ 2,421 76 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4.

Market valuations for the Companys inventories are adjusted for location and quality (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3. Changes in the fair value of inventories and inventory-related payables are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. 77 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1. The majority of the Companys exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets. Market valuations for the Companys forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are adjusted for location (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions and are considered observable. Basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these basis adjustments. In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity. When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2. When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3. Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net, depending upon the purpose of the contract. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur. The Companys cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The Companys segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1. The debt conversion option was the equity linked embedded derivative related to the exchangeable bonds. The fair value of the embedded derivative was included in long-term debt, with changes in fair value recognized as interest, and was valued with the assistance of a third-party pricing service (a level 3 measurement). 78 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Level 3 Fair Value Assets Measurements at December 31, 2023 Inventories Carried at Market Commodity Derivative Contracts Gains Total (In millions) Balance, December 31, 2022 $ 2,760 $ 541 $ 3,301 Total increase (decrease) in net realized/unrealized gains included in cost of products sold 432 1,460 1,892 Purchases 29,929  29,929 Sales ( 30,038 )  ( 30,038 ) Settlements ( 4 ) ( 1,559 ) ( 1,563 ) Transfers into Level 3 1,584 371 1,955 Transfers out of Level 3 ( 1,950 ) ( 82 ) ( 2,032 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2023 (1) $ 2,713 $ 731 $ 3,444 (1) Includes increase in unrealized gains of $ 2.1 billion relating to Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2023.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Level 3 Fair Value Assets Measurements at December 31, 2022 Inventories Carried at Market Commodity Derivative Contracts Gains Total (In millions) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 3,004 $ 460 $ 3,464 Total increase (decrease) in net realized/unrealized gains included in cost of products sold 867 1,648 2,515 Purchases 49,735  49,735 Sales ( 50,414 )  ( 50,414 ) Settlements  ( 1,672 ) ( 1,672 ) Transfers into Level 3 1,088 400 1,488 Transfers out of Level 3 ( 1,520 ) ( 295 ) ( 1,815 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2022 (1) $ 2,760 $ 541 $ 3,301 (1) Includes increase in unrealized gains of $ 2.7 billion relating to Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2022. Level 3 Fair Value Liabilities Measurements at December 31, 2022 Inventory- related Payables Commodity Derivative Contracts Losses Debt Conversion Option Total (In millions) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ 106 $ 815 $ 15 $ 936 Total increase (decrease) in net realized/unrealized losses included in cost of products sold and interest expense 3 2,483 ( 9 ) 2,477 Purchases 183   183 Sales ( 203 )   ( 203 ) Settlements  ( 2,844 )  ( 2,844 ) Transfers into Level 3  401  401 Transfers out of Level 3  ( 252 )  ( 252 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2022 (1) $ 89 $ 603 $ 6 $ 698 (1) Includes increase in unrealized losses of $ 2.5 billion relating to Level 3 liabilities still held at December 31, 2022. Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold. Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2. 80 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4. Fair Value Measurements (Continued) In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable. These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms. In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as basis. The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Companys Level 3 valuations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Companys Level 3 measurements may include basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components. As an example, for Level 3 inventories with basis, the unobservable component as of December 31, 2023 is a weighted average 25.0 % of the total price for assets and 33.2 % of the total price for liabilities. Weighted Average % of Total Price December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Component Type Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Inventories and Related Payables Basis 25.0 % 33.2 % 19.4 % 15.2 % Transportation cost 11.5 %  % 10.5 %  % Commodity Derivative Contracts Basis 24.2 % 24.9 % 22.7 % 26.5 % Transportation cost 9.3 % 3.2 % 13.5 % 3.7 % In certain of the Companys principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts. These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price. In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources. In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3. Note 5. Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The majority of the Companys derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments. The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural product inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies. The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and forward commodity purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural products, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at fair value or market value.

Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, inventory-related payables, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a component of cost of products sold. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net depending on the purpose of the contract. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Net Investment Hedging Instruments The Company had certain derivatives designated as cash flow and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flow that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period. Commodity Contracts For each of the hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains and losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable. The Company uses futures or options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys forecasted purchases of corn. The Companys corn processing plants normally grind approximately 59 million bushels per month. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 18 % and 34 % of its monthly grind. At December 31, 2023, the Company had designated hedges representing between 4 % to 28 % of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 12 months. The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to hedge the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts. The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts. The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys sales of ethanol. During the past 12 months and as of December 31, 2023, the Company had no hedges related to ethanol sales. The Company uses futures and options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of soybeans to be purchased and processed in a future month for certain of its U.S. soybean crush facilities, subject to certain program limits. The Company also uses futures or options contracts to hedge the sales prices of anticipated soybean meal and soybean oil sales proportionate to the soybean crushing process at these facilities, subject to certain program limits. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 77 % and 100 % of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities. At December 31, 2023, the Company had designated hedges representing between 0 % and 100 % of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities over the next 12 months. The Company uses futures and OTC swaps to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of natural gas consumption in a future month for certain of its facilities in North America and Europe, subject to certain program limits. During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 54 % and 85 % of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption at the designated facilities. At December 31, 2023, the Company had designated hedges representing between 38 % and 64 % of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption over the next 12 months. 83 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had after-tax gains of $ 42 million and after-tax losses of $ 17 million in AOCI, respectively, related to gains and losses from these programs. The Company expects to recognize $ 42 million of the 2023 after-tax gains in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months. Interest Rate Contracts The Company used swap locks designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the changes in the forecasted interest payments due to changes in the benchmark rate leading up to future bond issuance dates. The terms of the swap locks matched the terms of the forecasted interest payments. The deferred gains and losses will be recognized in interest expense over the period in which the related interest payments will be paid. As of December 31, 2022, the Company executed swap locks maturing on various dates with an aggregate notional amount of $ 400 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company unwound the swap locks in anticipation of the April 3, 2023 debt issuance. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards designated as net investment hedges to protect the Companys investment in a foreign subsidiary against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company executed USD-fixed to Euro-fixed cross-currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and foreign exchange forwards with an aggregate notional amount of $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are immaterial for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had after-tax losses of $ 5 million and after-tax gains of $ 79 million in AOCI, respectively, related to foreign exchange gains and losses from net investment hedge transactions. The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.

Stock Compensation The Companys employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Companys 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan. These options are issued at market value on the date of grant, vest incrementally over one year to five years , and expire ten years after the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model. The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The volatility of the Companys stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Companys stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant. The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants. No options were granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021. 90 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11.

In addition, the Companys 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan also provides for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees. Restricted Stock Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a restriction period of three years . Starting with the February 2023 grant, Restricted Stock Awards have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33.33 % each year. The awards for PSUs are made in common stock units and vest at the end of a vesting period of three years subject to the attainment of certain future service and performance criteria based on the Companys adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) with a modifier for gender parity and GHG emissions. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, 1.7 million, 2.3 million, and 2.7 million common stock or stock units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.

The total grant-date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $ 153 million. Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant. Certain of the Companys option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipients retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant. Compensation expense for PSUs is based on the probability of meeting the performance criteria. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 112 million, $ 147 million, and $ 161 million, respectively. Changes in incentive compensation expense are primarily caused by the level of attainment of the PSU performance criteria described above. Note 12. Other (Income) Expense  Net The following table sets forth the items in other (income) expense: (In millions) Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 Gains on sale of assets $ ( 38 ) $ ( 78 ) $ ( 100 ) Pension settlement   83 Other  net ( 138 ) ( 280 ) ( 77 ) $ ( 176 ) $ ( 358 ) $ ( 94 ) Individually significant items included in the table above are: Gains on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of gains on sales of certain assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business. Gains on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of gains on the sale of the Companys ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois of $ 22 million, the sale of certain other assets, and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business. Pension settlement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Companys ADM Retirement Plan and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees to independent third parties. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2023 included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 18 million, net foreign exchange gains of $ 85 million, and net other income. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Companys export facility in Reserve, Louisiana of $ 110 million, net foreign exchange gains of $ 105 million, a $ 50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 25 million, partially offset by net other expense. Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $ 16 million, net foreign exchange gains of $ 24 million, and net other income. 92 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13.

Income Taxes (Continued) Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate on earnings is as follows: Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 Statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 0.9 1.4 1.5 Foreign earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate ( 0.2 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 2.8 ) Foreign currency effects/remeasurement 0.5 0.6  Income tax adjustment to filed returns ( 0.4 ) ( 0.1 ) 0.7 Tax benefit on U.S. biodiesel credits ( 1.7 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 1.9 ) Tax benefit on U.S. railroad credits ( 1.5 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 2.0 ) U.S. tax on foreign earnings 1.2 0.2  Valuation allowances ( 0.2 )  0.7 Other ( 0.3 ) ( 0.3 ) 0.2 Effective income tax rate 19.3 % 16.6 % 17.4 % The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were impacted by the geographic mix of earnings. The effective tax rate for 2022 was also impacted by discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by the geographic mix of earnings and U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit. ADMs operations in foreign jurisdictions accounted for 57 %, 48 %, and 35 % of the Companys total pre-tax earnings in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The foreign rate differential was primarily due to various tax rates applicable to the income earned from the Companys operations in Switzerland, Asia, South America and the Caribbean. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Act), which includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15 % minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income, and a one percent excise tax on net repurchases of stock for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While the Inflation Act has no immediate impact and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on ADMs results of operations going forward, the Company will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures were approximately $ 17.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Because these undistributed earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no income taxes, other than the transition tax, the U.S. tax on undistributed Subpart F, and the minimum tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), have been provided after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures not subject to the transition tax. The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings over eight years. As of December 31, 2023, the Companys remaining transition tax liability was $ 85 million, which will be paid in installments through 2025. The Company incurred U.S. taxable income of $ 425 million, $ 684 million, and $ 244 million related to GILTI and deducted $ 77 million, $ 67 million, and $ 87 million related to Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost. The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes. The additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys net income or cash flow. 95 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued) The Company had $ 494 million and $ 496 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of certain international subsidiaries at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $ 412 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $ 82 million expire at various times through fiscal 2033. The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective foreign subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $ 160 million and $ 142 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization. The Company had $ 42 million of tax assets related to foreign capital loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $ 42 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to the uncertainty of their realization. The Company had $ 25 million and $ 21 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a majority of which will expire between 2024 and 2028. Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $ 14 million and $ 15 million related to state income tax assets net of federal tax benefit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance was related to the expiration of certain state income tax attributes which were fully reserved in prior years. The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2018 through 2023. The following table sets forth a rollforward of activity of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as follows: Unrecognized Tax Benefits December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 151 $ 157 Additions related to current years tax positions 2 6 Additions related to prior years tax positions 28 26 Additions (adjustments) related to acquisitions  11 Reductions related to lapse of statute of limitations ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 7 ) ( 43 ) Ending balance $ 168 $ 151 The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table included effects related to net income and shareholders equity. The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Companys net income or cash flow. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $ 52 million and $ 39 million, respectively. 96 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Income Taxes (Continued) The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations. However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months. Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Companys effective income tax rate in any given period. If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of $ 165 million on the tax expense for that period. In 2014, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., received a tax assessment from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization, which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands. As of December 31, 2023, this assessment was $ 90 million in tax and $ 34 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). On April 23, 2020, the court issued an unfavorable ruling and in October 2020, assigned a third party expert to establish a valuation. During the second quarter of 2021, the third party expert issued a final valuation. On September 30, 2022, the court issued a ruling consistent with the valuation report, and the Dutch tax authorities have filed an appeal. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, ADM filed a cross-appeal. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has accrued its best estimate of what it believes will be the likely outcome of the litigation. Note 14. Leases Lessee Accounting The Company leases certain transportation equipment, plant equipment, office equipment, land, buildings, and storage facilities. Most leases include options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 6 months to 49 years. The renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. Certain leases also include index and non-index escalation clauses and options to purchase the leased property. Leases accounted for as finance leases were immaterial at December 31, 2023. As an accounting policy election, the Company does not apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases in all of its underlying asset categories. The Company recognizes short-term lease payments in earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company also combines lease and non-lease contract components in all of its underlying asset categories as an accounting policy election. 97 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Leases (Continued) The following table sets forth the amounts relating to the Companys total lease cost and other information. Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Lease cost: Operating lease cost $ 390 $ 356 $ 336 Short-term lease cost 126 127 117 Total lease cost $ 516 $ 483 $ 453 Other information: Operating lease liability principal payments $ 374 $ 339 $ 325 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 327 $ 357 $ 197 December 31 2023 2022 Weighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases (in years) 7 7 Weighted average discount rate - operating leases 4.1 % 3.7 % Below is a tabular disclosure of the future annual undiscounted cash flows for operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023.

Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans. The Company also provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts. In 2021, the Company amended the ADM Retirement Plan and the ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees (collectively, the Plans) and entered into two binding agreements to purchase: (1) a group annuity contract from Principal Life Insurance Company (Principal) and (2) two group annuity contracts, separately from American General Life Insurance Company (AGL) and from AGLs affiliate, The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (USL), irrevocably transferring the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for approximately 6,000 retirees and terminated vested participants from the Plans to Principal, AGL, and USL. The purchase of the group annuity contracts was funded directly by the Plans assets and reduced the Companys pension obligations by approximately $ 0.7 billion. As a result of the transactions, the Company recognized a non-cash pretax pension settlement charge of $ 83 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. On July 31, 2017, the Company announced that all participants in the Companys U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) began accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1, 2022. Benefits for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula were frozen as of December 31, 2021, including pay and service through that date. The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1 % of pay to eligible participants. Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in the Companys stock as part of their own investment elections. Assets of the Companys 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds. The Companys 401(k) plans held 5.7 million shares of Company common stock at December 31, 2023, with a market value of $ 414 million. Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $ 10 million. The following table sets forth the components of retirement plan expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits (In millions) Year Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Retirement plan expense Defined benefit plans: Service cost (benefits earned during the period) $ 41 $ 48 $ 64 $  $ 1 $ 1 Interest cost 76 48 48 6 3 2 Expected return on plan assets ( 83 ) ( 79 ) ( 95 )    Settlement charges   83    Curtailments  ( 2 )     Amortization of actuarial loss 3 17 33 2 5 6 Amortization of prior service cost (credit) ( 20 ) ( 20 ) ( 20 )   ( 2 ) Net periodic defined benefit plan expense 17 12 113 8 9 7 Defined contribution plans 73 67 61    Total retirement plan expense $ 90 $ 79 $ 174 $ 8 $ 9 $ 7 99 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) The following tables set forth changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of defined benefit plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December 31 2023 December 31 2022 December 31 2023 December 31 2022 (In millions) (In millions) Benefit obligation, beginning $ 1,587 $ 2,178 $ 118 $ 154 Service cost 41 48  1 Interest cost 76 48 6 3 Actuarial loss (gain) 83 ( 575 ) 6 ( 24 ) Employee contributions 3 3   Curtailments  ( 2 )   Business combinations ( 1 )    Settlements ( 1 ) ( 1 )   Benefits paid ( 53 ) ( 47 ) ( 17 ) ( 16 ) Foreign currency effects 30 ( 65 )   Benefit obligation, ending $ 1,765 $ 1,587 $ 113 $ 118 Fair value of plan assets, beginning $ 1,269 $ 1,742 $  $  Actual return on plan assets 121 ( 438 )   Employer contributions 54 60 17 16 Employee contributions 3 3   Settlements ( 1 ) ( 1 )   Benefits paid ( 53 ) ( 47 ) ( 17 ) ( 16 ) Foreign currency effects 22 ( 50 )   Fair value of plan assets, ending $ 1,415 $ 1,269 $  $  Funded status $ ( 350 ) $ ( 318 ) $ ( 113 ) $ ( 118 ) Prepaid benefit cost $ 63 $ 60 $  $  Accrued benefit liability  current ( 19 ) ( 18 ) ( 14 ) ( 14 ) Accrued benefit liability  long-term ( 394 ) ( 360 ) ( 99 ) ( 104 ) Net amount recognized in the balance sheet $ ( 350 ) $ ( 318 ) $ ( 113 ) $ ( 118 ) In 2023, the actuarial loss in the pension plans was primarily due to decreases in the global bond yields while actual return on plan assets was related to favorable asset performance in countries with material assets including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Switzerland. The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses. Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods. For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants. For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants. The amortization periods range from 4 to 27 years for the Companys defined benefit pension plans and from 5 to 18 years for the Companys postretirement benefit plans. Included in AOCI for pension benefits at December 31, 2023, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $ 56 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $ 272 million. 100 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Included in AOCI for postretirement benefits at December 31, 2023, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost: unrecognized prior service cost of $ 1 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $ 20 million. The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing net periodic benefit cost: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December 31 2023 December 31 2022 December 31 2023 December 31 2022 Discount rate 4.8 % 2.5 % 5.1 % 2.7 % Expected return on plan assets 6.0 % 5.0 % N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 4.3 % 4.2 % N/A N/A Interest crediting rate 3.9 % 1.9 % N/A N/A The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December 31 2023 December 31 2022 December 31 2023 December 31 2022 Discount rate 4.5 % 4.8 % 4.9 % 5.1 % Rate of compensation increase 4.8 % 4.3 % N/A N/A Interest crediting rate 4.0 % 3.9 % N/A N/A The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and $ 1.3 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 0.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.2 billion, and $ 0.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 6.9 % annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended December 31, 2023. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % by 2031 and remain at that level thereafter. Plan Assets The Companys employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments: Common stock: Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Mutual funds: Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 101 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Common collective trust (CCT) funds: The fair values of the CCTs are valued using net asset value (NAV). The investments in CCTs are comprised of U.S. and international equity, fixed income, and other securities. The investments are valued at NAV provided by administrators of the funds. Corporate debt instruments: Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. Treasury instruments: U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds: U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The actual asset allocation for the Companys U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 20 % equity securities and 80 % debt securities. The target asset allocation for the Companys U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation. The actual asset allocation for the Companys foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 17 % equity securities, 71 % debt securities, and 12 % other. The target asset allocation for the Companys foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation. (2) The Companys pension plans did not directly hold any shares of Company common stock as of the December 31, 2023 and 2022 measurement dates. 103 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Investment objectives for the Companys plan assets are to:  Optimize the long-term return on plan assets in consideration of funded status risk.  Maintain a broad diversification of assets and appropriate risk exposure across asset classes.  Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class. Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically. Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable. In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments. The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Companys plan assets. To develop the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies. Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets. Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments Based on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute $ 27 million to the pension plans and $ 14 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2024. The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the benefit plans: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits (In millions) 2024 $ 69 $ 14 2025 75 13 2026 82 11 2027 88 11 2028 94 10 2029-2033 559 41 Note 16.

Segment and Geographic Information (Continued) Intersegment sales have been recorded using principles consistent with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales less identifiable operating expenses. Also included in operating profit for each segment is equity in earnings of affiliates based on the equity method of accounting. Specified items included in total segment operating profit and certain corporate items are not allocated to the Companys individual business segments because operating performance of each business segment is evaluated by management exclusive of these items. Corporate results principally include unallocated corporate expenses, interest cost net of interest income, and revaluation gains and losses on cost method investments and the share of the results of equity investments in early-stage start-up companies. Correction of Certain Segment-Specific Historical Financial Information As previously disclosed, the Company received a voluntary document request from the SEC relating to intersegment sales between the Companys Nutrition segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments. In response, the Company engaged external counsel, assisted by a forensic accounting firm, to conduct an internal investigation, overseen by the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, which is separately advised by external counsel (the Investigation). The Company has historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified certain intersegment sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 through 2023 that occurred between the Companys Nutrition segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The correction of these immaterial errors does not have any impact on the Companys previously reported Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for any of the periods presented below. The following tables present: (i) adjustments and revised gross revenues, intersegment revenues, and operating profit amounts for the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment; (ii) adjustments and revised gross revenues, intersegment revenues and operating profit amounts for the Carbohydrate Solutions segment; and (iii) adjustments and revised operating profit amounts for the Nutrition segment, in each case, for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. No adjustments were required to the gross revenues of the Nutrition segment.

ADM Ireland Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the Second Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable. In exchange, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $ 1.1 billion ( 1.0 billion) for the accounts receivables transferred. The Second Program terminates on April 19, 2024, unless extended. Under the First and Second Programs (collectively, the Programs), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the First Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers) and other consideration, as applicable, to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables. The Company accounts for these transfers as sales. The Company acts as a servicer for the transferred receivables. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold. 114 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Companys consolidated balance sheet was $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. Total receivables sold were $ 54.8 billion, $ 59.0 billion, and $ 50.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $ 53.6 billion, $ 56.9 billion, and $ 47.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Receivables pledged as collateral to the Purchasers were $ 1.1 billion and $ 0.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Transfers of receivables under the Programs during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $ 56 million, $ 21 million, and $ 11 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company reflects cash flows related to the Programs as operating activities because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Companys trade receivables. Note 20. Legal Proceedings The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution. The outcomes of these matters are not within Companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. 115 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20. Legal Proceedings (Continued) Commodities Class Actions On September 4, 2019, AOT Holding AG (AOT) filed a putative class action under the U.S. Commodities Exchange Act in federal district court in Urbana, Illinois, alleging that the Company sought to manipulate the benchmark price used to price and settle ethanol derivatives traded on futures exchanges. On March 16, 2021, AOT filed an amended complaint adding a second named plaintiff Maize Capital Group, LLC (Maize). AOT and Maize allege that members of the putative class collectively suffered damages calculated to be between approximately $ 500 million to over $ 2.0 billion as a result of the Companys alleged actions. On July 14, 2020, Green Plains Inc. and its related entities (GP) filed a putative class action lawsuit, alleging substantially the same operative facts, in federal court in Nebraska, seeking to represent sellers of ethanol. On July 23, 2020, Midwest Renewable Energy, LLC (MRE) filed a putative class action in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same operative facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act. On November 11, 2020, United Wisconsin Grain Producers LLC (UWGP) and five other ethanol producers filed a lawsuit in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act and Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin law. The court granted ADMs motion to dismiss the MRE and UWGP complaints without prejudice on August 9, 2021 and September 28, 2021, respectively. On August 16, 2021, the court granted ADMs motion to dismiss the GP complaint, dismissing one claim with prejudice and declining jurisdiction over the remaining state law claim. MRE filed an amended complaint on August 30, 2021, which ADM moved to dismiss on September 27, 2021. The court denied ADMs motion to dismiss on September 26, 2023. UWGP filed an amended complaint on October 19, 2021, which the court dismissed on July 12, 2022. UWGP has appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On October 26, 2021, GP filed a new complaint in Nebraska federal district court, alleging substantially the same facts and asserting a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. On March 18, 2022, the Nebraska federal district court granted ADMs motion to transfer the GP case back to the Central District of Illinois for further proceedings. ADM moved to dismiss the complaint on May 20, 2022 and on December 30, 2022, the court dismissed GPs complaint with prejudice. GP appealed the dismissal. As of December 31, 2023, the appeal was pending. The Company denies liability, and is vigorously defending itself in these actions. As these actions are in pretrial proceedings, the Company is unable at this time to predict the final outcome with any reasonable degree of certainty, but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Intersegment Sales Investigations On June 30, 2023, the Company received a voluntary document request from the SEC relating to intersegment sales between the Companys Nutrition reporting segment and the Companys Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. The Company is cooperating with the SEC. Following the Companys January 21, 2024 announcement of the Investigation, the Company received voluntary document requests from the DOJ focused primarily on the same subject matter, and the DOJ directed grand jury subpoenas to certain current and former Company employees. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of these investigations with any reasonable degree of certainty. Securities Litigation On January 24, 2024, following the Companys January 21, 2024 announcement of the investigation relating to intersegment sales, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, as well as Vikram Luthar and Ray Young. The plaintiff alleges false and misleading statements in the Companys disclosures. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this proceeding with any reasonable degree of certainty. 116 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 21.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 12, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 119 Market or Fair Values of Certain Merchandisable Agricultural Commodity Inventories, Inventory-Related Payables, and Forward Commodity Purchase and Sales Contracts Description of the Matter As explained in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory and inventory-related payables are stated at market or fair value. Forward commodity purchase and sales contracts that qualify as derivative contracts are also stated at market or fair value. The merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are considered level 2 and 3 fair value instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the market or fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, forward commodity contracts in an asset position, and forward commodity contracts in a liability position were $6,987 million, $1,320 million, $1,359 million, and $957 million, respectively. Auditing the estimated market or fair values for merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is complex due to the judgment involved in determining market or fair value, specifically related to determining the estimated basis adjustments, which represent the adjustment made to exchange quoted prices to arrive at the market or fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts. The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor or broker quotations or market transactions and are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market. Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact these basis adjustments. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys determination of the estimated market or fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. Our tests included controls over the estimation process supporting the basis adjustments. To test the estimated market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating (i) the Companys selection of the principal market, (ii) the inputs for the basis adjustments, and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the basis adjustments. For example, we evaluated managements methodology for determining the basis adjustment including assessing the principal market identified and sources utilized by management to support the basis adjustment. Specifically, we compared the basis adjustments used by management to competitor and broker quotations, trade publications, and/or recently executed transactions. Further, we investigated, to the extent necessary, basis adjustments that were inconsistent with third party available information. Finally, we evaluated the adequacy of the Companys financial statement disclosures related to the estimated market or fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. Animal Nutrition Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Companys total goodwill was $4.1 billion of which $0.9 billion was assigned to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the Companys reporting units as of the acquisition date. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually on October 1, or when events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company uses an income and market approach in its quantitative impairment tests. During 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $137 million related to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit that represented the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit at the impairment testing date. Auditing the Companys Animal Nutrition goodwill impairment charge was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate using a weighted income and market approach was sensitive to significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins, and the discount rate. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions and the performance of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. 120 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the estimated fair value used in the Companys Animal Nutrition reporting unit goodwill impairment charge, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to revenue growth rates and projected EBITDA margins, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical results and current industry and economic trends, as applicable. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company to determine the fair value of reporting unit and testing of the significant assumptions used by management, including the discount rate. Specifically, we evaluated the components of the discount rate used by the Company with the involvement of our valuation specialists. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 1930. Saint Louis, Missouri March 12, 2024 121 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment. Management has identified a material weakness related to the Companys accounting practices and procedures for intersegment transactions between the Nutrition segment and the Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments. The absence of adequate controls with respect to the reporting of intersegment sales impacted the accuracy of the Companys segment disclosures and review controls over key inputs and assumptions utilized by the Company when performing the goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 12, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 122 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Saint Louis, Missouri March 12, 2024 123 Item 9.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to the material weakness described below. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, the Companys management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because the control deficiency described below could have resulted in a material misstatement of its annual or interim financial statements, the Company determined that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness. During the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Companys accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts that were not in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Specifically, the Company did not have adequate controls in place around measurement of certain intersegment sales between the Nutrition reporting segment and the Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. The absence of adequate controls with respect to the reporting of intersegment sales impacted the accuracy of the Companys segment disclosures and review controls over projected financial information utilized in goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment tests. Notwithstanding such material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. That report is included herein. /s/ Juan R. Luciano Juan R. Luciano Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President /s/ Ismael Roig Ismael Roig Senior Vice President and Interim Chief Financial 

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

D PROCEDURES (Continued) Remediation Plan The Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate the identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Companys accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales and to enhance the reliability of its financial statements with respect to the pricing and reporting of such sales. Specifically, the Company is: (i) enhancing the Companys accounting policies with respect to the measurement of intersegment sales; (ii) improving and documenting the Companys pricing guidelines for intersegment sales; (iii) enhancing the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement controls for segment disclosure purposes and projected financial information used in impairment analyses; and (iv) increasing training for relevant personnel on the measurement of and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales. While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. In 2023, the Company deployed the ERP system to 18 legal entities. The Company has appropriately considered this change in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded, as part of the evaluation described above, the implementation of the new ERP system in these instances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting. Except for the material weakness described above and the related remediation measures that are being implemented, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
