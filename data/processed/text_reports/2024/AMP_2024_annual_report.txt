=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

 1. Business Overview Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a nearly 130-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to Ameriprise, Ameriprise Financial, the Company, we, us, and our may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice offering a broad range of products and services designed to assist individual and institutional clients achieve their financial objectives. Our strategy is centered on helping clients confidently achieve their goals by providing holistic advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management. Wealth Management Our Advice & Wealth Management business is the primary growth engine of Ameriprise with a significant market opportunity. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the U.S., the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement, as well as younger generations currently building their wealth and planning for retirement, continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. Our primary target market is households with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets, and we are also well-suited to serve those outside this asset range. The amount of investable assets held by investors grew at an 8% compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2022. We also offer products and services targeted to higher-net worth households. We are an industry-leading wealth manager with a differentiated advice value proposition. Our network of more than 10,000 financial advisors (our advisors) is the primary channel through which we carry out our wealth management activities. Our capabilities are centered on establishing long-term personal relationships between clients and advisors. Through our affiliated advisors, we offer financial planning and advice, cash management and banking products, and full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients. We design products and services as solutions for clients cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, retirement, protection, income generation and disbursement and estate and wealth transfer needs. The financial solutions we offer through our advisors include our own products and services as well as other providers products. We distribute our life and disability income insurance, as well as annuity products, through our advisor channel. Our advisor force is among the largest in the industry and is central to how we serve our clients. We support our advisors with an integrated technology platform, training, leadership and marketing programs to assist them in serving their clients and growing their practices. Our nationally recognized brand combined with these programs and other support creates a compelling value proposition for financial advisors relative to the broader financial services industry. This is evidenced by our strong advisor retention and satisfaction and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We continuously invest in, develop, and refine capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction. Asset Management Our global asset management business, represented by the Columbia Threadneedle Investments  brand, offers a broad spectrum of capabilities to individual, institutional and high net worth investors. In November 2021, we purchased the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business and subsequently re-branded the business. Columbia Threadneedle  investment products are primarily offered through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor network, direct retail and through our institutional sales force. Our underlying asset management philosophy is rooted in delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance. The quality and breadth of our asset management capabilities are demonstrated by our strong investment performance. We are positioned to grow our assets under management and strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. We benefit from key strategic relationships we have established and have a strong institutional presence. Our asset management capabilities are designed to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe as well as expanding into new global and emerging markets. We have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (U.K.) to serve more clients and gather assets worldwide. We continue to pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global asset management business in order to enhance our investment solutions and to develop new solutions that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex and competitive marketplace. History and Development Our company has provided solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives for nearly 130 years. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express acquisition of IDS Financial Services from 1 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Alleghany Corporation. We changed our name to American Express Financial Corporation (AEFC) and began marketing our products and services under the American Express brand in 1994. In 2005, AEFC spun off from American Express to form Ameriprise Financial, Inc. We have grown both organically in the products and services we provide, as well as inorganically through strategic acquisitions. This has allowed us to significantly enhance the scale, performance, and product offerings of our brokerage, financial planning, retail mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses to best serve clients. Our acquisitions have included Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings, H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc., J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated, Columbia Management, Emerging Global Advisors, LLC, Investment Professionals, Inc., Lionstone Partners, Inc., and, most recently, BMO Financial Groups European-based asset management business, which was completed in 2021. Beyond traditional acquisitions, we pursue other strategies to grow our Wealth Management business such as experienced advisor recruiting and partnerships with banks and credit unions, like the transaction to become Comerica Banks new investment program provider. Over the years, we have also sought to optimize the organizational structure in which we offer certain banking products. In May 2019, we received regulatory approvals and converted Ameriprise National Trust Bank to Ameriprise Bank, FSB (Ameriprise Bank) to expand the products and services we can provide directly to our customers. At that time, Ameriprise Financial became a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and Ameriprise Financial elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. On July 13, 2023, we announced that we withdrew our application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB to a state-chartered industrial bank and our application to establish a new limited purpose national trust bank. We plan to continue to operate Ameriprise Bank as we have, under the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and continue to offer a strong lineup of banking solutions without interruption. Our Shifting Business Mix and Integrated Model The financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our operating segments:  Advice & Wealth Management;  Asset Management;  Retirement & Protection Solutions; and  Corporate & Other. 2 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. As a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather and retain assets is best measured by our aggregate assets under management and administration metric. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.4 trillion in assets under management and administration, compared to $1.2 trillion as of December 31, 2022. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management and administration, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to execute on our strategy to grow our Wealth Management business with complementary Asset Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions businesses. The following chart shows our current business mix represented by the contributions of each segment to our pretax adjusted operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison. Our Principal Brands Our diversified products and services are offered through our brands: We use the Ameriprise Financial  brand as our enterprise brand, as well as the name of our advisor network and certain of our retail products and services. Our global Columbia Threadneedle  and Columbia Threadneedle Investments  brands represent the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (including its subsidiaries, Columbia Management), other U.S.-based entities and Threadneedle. The foreign operations of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. are conducted primarily through Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Limited, TAM UK International Holdings Limited and Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings Singapore (Pte.) and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, Threadneedle). We use our RiverSource  brand for our annuity and protection products issued by RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life) and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (RiverSource Life of NY and, together with RiverSource Life, the RiverSource Life companies or RiverSource). Our Segments - Advice & Wealth Management We provide financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive, holistic approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals. Banking, lending and cash management solutions help clients establish financial flexibility while planning for both short and long- 3 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. term needs. As part of our goal-based approach to financial advice, our advisors help clients actively manage investing, saving and spending so they have a more complete picture of their financial life. A significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net flows. We also earn revenue and income through other sources, including the following:  We earn net investment income on owned assets from Ameriprise Certificate Company and Ameriprise Bank, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Ameriprise.  We earn financial planning fees as well as transaction and other fees.  We earn distribution fees for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. Our Financial Advisor Platform With more than 10,000 advisors, we are one of the top branded advisor platforms in the U.S. market. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in multiple ways as noted below, and each option offers different levels of support and compensation. We offer the following products and services through our Advice & Wealth Management segment:  Financial planning and advice services to provide personalized financial planning and financial solutions for which we charge fees and may receive sales commissions for selling products that aid in our clients plans.  Discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts for which we receive fees based on the assets held in that account, as well as related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account.  Brokerage products and services for retail and institutional clients.  Cash management and banking products, including brokerage sweep programs, cash management accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit.  Face-amount certificates through the Ameriprise Certificate Company, a wholly owned subsidiary.  Mutual fund offerings from our own Columbia funds as well as approximately 135 unaffiliated mutual fund families, representing approximately 2,150 mutual funds on our brokerage platform for which mutual fund families and other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from sales of those funds, administrative fees, and fees from the ongoing management attributable to our clients ownership in the fund.  Insurance and annuities products from both RiverSource Life companies as well as certain third parties, and we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of unaffiliated products and certain administrative fees. Our Segments - Asset Management Through Columbia Threadneedle, we provide investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale. 4 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the United States. Threadneedle, including BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business which we acquired in 2021, primarily provides products and services internationally. Additional subsidiaries beyond Columbia Management and Threadneedle are also included in our Asset Management segment. Revenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. As of December 31, 2023, our Asset Management segment had $637 billion in worldwide managed assets. Our Asset Management segment also provides asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Retirement & Protection Solutions, and Corporate & Other segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. Managed assets include external client assets and owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments fund families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select but do not include client assets that we advise on a non-discretionary basis such as those assets where we provide voting recommendations and engagement services but do not manage the underlying assets. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles and details regarding the consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account, cash balances invested by Ameriprise Bank and from certificate products, and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of RiverSource Life companies) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees.

Investment Management Capabilities and Products Our investment management business has a presence in 17 key markets globally with investment offices in seven countries, including France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. Our investment management capabilities and products span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles to meet a variety of client needs with our $637 billion in assets under management diversified across geographies, strategies and clients.

Non-U.S. retail focused funds through Columbia Threadneedle include different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, which include retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds (such as Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds organized as Luxembourg-based investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs) and Irish and U.K. open-end investment companies (OEICs)). In addition, this also includes a range of listed Investment Trusts, including F&C Investment Trust PLC established in 1868.  European-based pooled investment funds designed for pensions, insurance companies and other institutional investors seeking solutions for liability or balance sheet asset management (Liability Driven Investment or LDI). 5 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.  Institutional and retail separately managed accounts for a range of clients, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high net worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations for which we receive management and performance-related fees.  Other separately managed accounts, including those offered through models that represent assets under advisement.  Management of owned assets such as assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies, Ameriprise Certificate Company and Ameriprise Bank.  Management of CLOs, which includes providing collateral management services to special purpose vehicles that primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets for which we earn fees based on the value of assets and performance-based fees.  Private funds of various types where we provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other entities for which we may receive fees based on the value of the assets or performance-based fees.  Collective funds and separately managed accounts sponsored by Ameriprise Trust Company (ATC) and offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension, and profit-sharing plans for which we receive management fees.  Sub-advised accounts for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds, and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms for which we earn management fees and possibly performance-based fees. Distribution We maintain distribution teams and capabilities that aid the sales, marketing, and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution. However, alternatives and certain other areas have a level of specialized distribution. Our Segments - Retirement & Protection Solutions RiverSource solutions are one way we deliver on the Ameriprise client experience and Confident Retirement  approach. We offer clients annuities, life insurance and disability income insurance products to meet their needs or current stage in lifewhether that is covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected or leaving a legacy. RiverSource seeks to partner with our advisors to address clients goals and long-term needs at a differentiated level and provide a strong risk profile. Retirement Solutions Through our advisors, we provide RiverSource annuity products to clients to help individuals address their asset accumulation and income goals. Our advisor network is the only distributor of new RiverSource annuity products, although advisors offer fixed, variable, and structured annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers. As part of the continued evolution of the business model for our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment, we focus on the accumulation solutions clients want (such as the structured variable annuity, a registered index-linked annuity). Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on a contractholders benefit base, contract value or separate account values, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for non-life contingent payout annuities, structured variable annuities, certain guaranteed benefits and fixed investment options offered with variable annuities, and on capital supporting the business. In addition, we receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested. Revenues for our payout annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. Protection We provide life and disability income insurance products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients. New RiverSource insurance products are exclusively offered through our advisor network. Our advisors also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers. The primary sources of revenues for our protection business are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and on capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies separate account assets supporting variable universal life investment options. The protection products earn intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for the protection products include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results. 6 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Products Through the RiverSource Life companies, we currently offer the following products:  Variable annuities provide returns linked to underlying investments of the contractholders choice of certain funds, as well as additional benefits, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (but without living benefits for new sales after mid-2022).  Structured variable annuities use the performance of an underlying equity market index to determine earnings, subject to either a cap or floor.  Variable universal life insurance provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholders choice.  Universal life insurance credits interest at fixed interest rates. Universal life insurance may also contain product features that credit interest at a rate linked to an underlying equity market index.  Term life insurance provides a death benefit, but it does not accumulate cash value.  Disability income insurance provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability or at any suitable occupation for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change. Our sales of RiverSource individual life insurance in 2023, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of approximately 95% variable universal life, 2% universal life and 3% term life. Reinsurance We reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our currently offered life and disability income products (as well as previously sold fixed annuity, fixed indexed annuity, life contingent payout annuity and long term care products) through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large risks and provide additional capacity for continued product offerings. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our RiverSource Life companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance. At a general level, we reinsure some or all of the following (with the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment): Product Reinsurance Type Term Life and Disability Income Coinsurance Universal Life & Variable Universal Life Renewable Term Life Contingent Payout Annuity Coinsurance Fixed Annuity (closed block in Corporate & Other) Coinsurance Long Term Care (closed block in Corporate & Other) Coinsurance Our Segments - Corporate & Other Our Corporate & Other segment consists of closed blocks of business and net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Closed Block Long Term Care Insurance Prior to December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies underwrote stand-alone long term care (LTC) insurance. We discontinued offering LTC insurance as of December 31, 2002. A large majority of our closed block LTC is comprised of nursing home indemnity LTC or comprehensive reimbursement LTC. Generally, our policyholders are eligible for LTC benefits if they become cognitively impaired or unable to perform certain activities of daily living. Nursing home indemnity LTC policies provide a predefined daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home, subject to various maximum benefit periods, regardless of actual expenses of the policyholder. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were primarily written between 1989 through 1999 and represent nearly one half of our policies. Comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies provide a predefined maximum daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home and covers a variety of LTC expenses, including assisted living, home and community care, adult day care and similar placement programs, subject to various maximum total benefit payment pools, on a cost-reimbursement basis. Our second-generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies were written from 1997 until 2002. Our closed block LTC was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for LTC policies vary by age, benefit period, elimination period, home care coverage and benefit increase option. Premium rates are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. In line with the market, we have pursued nationwide premium rate increases for many years and expect to continue to pursue rate increases over the next several years. In general, since very little of our LTC business is subject to rate stability regulation, we have historically followed a policy of pursuing smaller, more frequent increases in order to align policyholder and historic shareholder objectives but modified our approach 7 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. in 2019 to seek larger increases as an additional method to manage the LTC business. We also provide policyholders with options to reduce their coverage to lessen or eliminate the additional financial outlay that would otherwise result. For existing LTC policies, RiverSource Life has continued ceding 50% of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, we have the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth. For more information regarding LTC, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Corporate & Other included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Closed Block Fixed Annuities In 2020, we discontinued new sales of fixed annuities and moved the Fixed Annuities and Fixed Indexed Annuities blocks to the Corporate & Other segment as a closed block. In this closed block, as of December 31, 2023, we have $6.3 billion of account value associated with our fixed annuities of which 89% has been ceded by RiverSource Life on a coinsurance basis to Global Atlantic Financial Groups subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth) under customary reinsurance arrangements with a comfort trust. For the ceded policies, RiverSource Life ceded 100% of the risk on a coinsurance basis. Competition We operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisers, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. We directly compete for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients, and we increasingly compete with various financial technology companies. Our Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisers, insurance companies and other banks and financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings and innovation, growth opportunities, and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels. This includes wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings, technology offerings for clients and advisors and service quality. Our Asset Management segment competes on a global basis against a substantial number of firms to acquire and retain managed and administered assets, including firms in the categories listed above. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, technology and service quality, brand recognition, reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. Furthermore, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, active or passive investing styles), client interest in funds with particular environmental, social, or governance practices, client or regulatory requirements on use of client commissions for research, and downward pressure on fees may present various challenges to our business and could cause clients to favor certain competitors, such as those that focus more on passive or value-style investing. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. Competitors of our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of variable annuity and insurance products include distribution capabilities, price, product features and innovation, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, reinsurance availability and pricing, perceived financial strength and financial strength ratings, claims-paying ratings, technology and service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Human Capital Management Ameriprise Financial has a strong values-driven and inclusive culture that is the foundation of all that we do. While our individual business lines serve different client needs, we have a common vision and values that drive our business and how we work with clients and each other. Our values are the following:  Client focused;  Integrity always;  Excellence in all we do; and  Respect for the individuals and for the communities in which we live and work. To ensure our long-term success, we must attract, retain, engage and develop a diverse, high-performing workforce. We are committed to providing an excellent employee and advisor experience for all of our people. This includes approximately 13,800 global 8 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. employees, including our corporate employees and employee financial advisors. We have approximately 8,400 non-employee advisors who choose to affiliate with us through our franchise advisor group. Leadership and training are core to our culture and history, and we offer an extensive employee development curriculum, broad resources and a comprehensive and competitive benefits program to support our employees in their growth and well-being. This includes extensive professional development programs supporting both new employees and those who are longer-tenured to help them grow and explore their career potential at Ameriprise. Starting in 2023, we worked closely with leaders to prioritize organizational stewardship, leadership excellence and operating effectiveness as we executed our business plans. We continually invest in our human capital programs and capabilities to ensure a highly competitive employee value proposition and offer a framework for employees and prospective employees to understand the investments we make in them, including our culture, compensation and benefits, well-being, work environment and career development. Our Board of Directors engages in these topics and annually reviews our senior executive succession plans and broader talent development status in support of our corporate strategy, and frequently discusses talent topics at meetings. The Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee are regularly updated on human capital management topics and dedicate time to reviewing and discussing our company culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, diversity, our equity and inclusion (DEI) strategy, and our annual engagement survey feedback. In 2023, our strong corporate culture yielded the following results:  Our employee engagement results are among the strongest in the industry  exceeding industry benchmarks overall at 85% with particular strength in the metrics of integrity, leader effectiveness, respect, and client focus. Consistent with prior years, we had strong participation with 94% of employees participating in our survey.  We prioritize professional development, with 96% of our employees participating in development training. We continue to invest in our employees development, and, in addition to annual training requirements and annual compliance training, we encourage all employees to participate in our professional development programs, including core curriculum for new hires and a Transformational Leader Program for officers. Leaders are further supported by a broad selection of online courses, workshops, mentoring opportunities, networking events and peer-to-peer programs.  In addition to recruiting talented professionals to join Ameriprise, we retained 95% of our high-performing employees.  Within our advisor force, the retention rate among affiliated advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years remained strong at 94%.  We have also continued to attract experienced, productive advisors, with 412 experienced advisors moving their practices to Ameriprise in 2023 and approximately 1,734 over the last 5 years.  Our global workforce is comprised of 40% women and among our U.S.-based employees 21% are ethnically diverse. More detail on our workforce composition with a summary of our Equal Employment Opportunity metrics can be found in our Ameriprise Responsible Business report, which is available on our website. Information contained on or accessible through our websites is not incorporated into and does not form a part of this Form 10-K or any other report or document we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. With regard to DEI, our vision is to foster an inclusive culture and diverse workforce so that everyone at Ameriprise believes they can belong, grow and contribute to a culture that helps them realize their potential. One way in which we measure our progress is through our updated Inclusion Index from our engagement survey where we achieved a score of 85% in 2023, which exceeds the industry benchmark. These results and our progress are guided by our comprehensive DEI strategy and plan that is approved by the Chairman and CEO and reviewed by our Board of Directors. We invest in programs to attract, retain and advance diverse talent, including a robust leadership development curriculum for employees and advisors. In 2023, we hosted our 6 th Annual Global Inclusion Celebration, which included over 5,300 attendees. Our focus on fostering a diverse and inclusive culture is also reflected in the policies and practices that promote a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. Our 13 business resource networks engage more than 21,000 participants globally each year to help promote cultural awareness and community involvement while providing employees and advisors with wellness and career development resources. Another important priority is our investment in our total rewards and benefits programs that are designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees with deliberate alignment of rewards with performance. Weighing both individual goal achievement (the what) and leadership performance (the how) is critical to driving strong business results. We have a competitive total rewards approach that includes base salary, annual cash awards and long-term incentives, as well as a comprehensive benefits strategy for employees that focuses on physical, social, emotional and financial wellness. In an evolving and highly competitive industry, we have continued to successfully execute on our strategy and deliver solid performance, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our values-based, inclusive culture and the effectiveness of our human capital strategy. 9 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, and patent registrations and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered, or filed applications to register, certain trademarks and service marks that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to the Ameriprise Financial, Threadneedle, RiverSource, Columbia Threadneedle and Columbia Threadneedle Investments brands. We have in the past and will continue to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Enterprise Risk Management Enterprise risk management and our risk management program is an important component in how we manage our business. All operating subsidiaries of Ameriprise must comply with our enterprise risk management policy and framework, which: (i) establishes a structure for effective enterprise risk management, including oversight and governance; (ii) delineates key constituent roles and responsibilities; and (iii) imposes a number of core risk management processes. The enterprise risk management policy is designed to manage risks that may impact Ameriprise, including capital, credit, market, liquidity, operational, strategic, reputational, legal and compliance, and product. The enterprise risk management policy is supported by underlying risk policies at business units that provide further detail on the business units risk governance, appetite, and tolerance. Regulation Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of the parent company and our subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations are significant and increasing, and the consequences for the failure to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations and reputational damage. We have made and expect to need to continue to make significant investments in our compliance and supervision processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. We operate in a highly scrutinized regulatory environment and it remains subject to change. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and fiduciary initiatives, as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) consideration and responsible investing; cybersecurity and resilience; the use of artificial intelligence; responsible information and data collection, storage and use; financial crime prevention; and privacy matters, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. States in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. continue to add new complexity to the patchwork of laws and regulations already in existence relating to privacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and other areas and we are expecting similar new laws at the federal level and in multiple states in the U.S. The same complexity resulting from multiple standards exists for retirement investing where individual states and federal regulators continue to propose or enact their own rules. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact how we are regulated and how we operate and govern our businesses. The discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the primary laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report. 10 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Advice & Wealth Management Regulation Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements (which includes rules around customer protection) and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital 11 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent, and they have proposed regulations regarding cybersecurity programs and the public reporting of incidents impacting broker-dealers like ours. Our financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant, meaning it is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, information security, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. We continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection. The SECs Regulation Best Interest standard of care became effective June 30, 2020 and the SEC continues to issue various statements and other guidance on complying with the regulation. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g., insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) finalized its voluntary exemption for providing investment advice to retirement account clients and has reinstated prior guidance for determining who is an investment advice fiduciary under pension regulations. While not a regulator, the Certified Financial Planner Board professional standards of conduct includes a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that continue to be proposed, finalized, and sometimes withdrawn or amended, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule. Other agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA). Certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and may be subject to the regulations described in the following sections. Asset Management Regulation U.S. Regulation Certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to U.S. registered investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion. This trend is especially true globally where regulators remain active, including in Europe. Any future regulation could potentially require new approaches which increase our regulatory burdens and costs. Many aspects of the regulation that applies to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for Columbia Management funds and other products. Additionally, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), the SECs best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL would be relevant to our global asset management business. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines. In addition, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. In this regard, we are subject to additional registration and reporting requirements with respect to certain registered investment companies and other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation. U.K. Regulation Outside of the U.S., Columbia Threadneedle is authorized to conduct its financial services business in the U.K. under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. A number of legal entities in the Columbia Threadneedle business are currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and one entity in the Columbia Threadneedle business is also regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. As with the U.S. regulatory environment, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services. Key U.K. regulatory developments and trends include the following:  Operational Resilience: Under this new U.K. regulatory requirement, in scope firms must identify their important business services, which if unavailable, could cause intolerable harm to clients, which they could not reasonably recover, or market disruption. The regulations introduce a new concept of impact tolerance and firms are also required to stress test their important business services and appoint a senior manager accountable for the regime. 12 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.  Financial Resilience: European Union (EU) and U.K. regulators have revised the prudential regime applying to asset managers and investment firms. This is being phased in over a five-year period and introduces a number of new concepts, including new capital requirements.  FCA Consumer Duty: The FCA recently introduced a new Consumer Duty that sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail consumers.  Sustainability Disclosure Requirements : The FCA recently finalized new requirements that will take effect during 2024 and 2025 that will introduce new ESG retail product labels, naming and marketing rules, additional ESG disclosure requirements both at an entity and product level, and an anti-greenwashing rule covering all products and services irrespective of the investor category.  DEI : The FCA recently launched a consultation on a potential new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector. The consultation also incorporated additional proposed rules around firms handling of non-financial misconduct in the context of adherence to the FCAs conduct and fitness and propriety regimes. Our U.K. asset management business must comply with local EU and country requirements as a non-EU firm, which includes leveraging our various EU-based affiliated entities (such as those in Luxembourg and the Netherlands) to provide services and marketing to EU clients and investors. We continue to actively monitor the political activity around Brexit, including with respect to the continued permissibility of the delegation of asset management services from the EU to non-EU countries such as the U.S. and U.K. We have an established fund range domiciled in Luxembourg (both UCITS and Alternative Investment Funds), Ireland and the Netherlands, along with Luxembourg-based and Netherlands-based affiliated management companies. Our Luxembourg and Netherlands affiliates may perform fund management, administration and distribution functions. Therefore, we are well placed to continue to serve investors in the EU. Pan-European and Other Non-U.S. Regulation In addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries and branches are required to comply with pan-European directives as issued by the European Commission and adopted by EU member states. Certain of these directives have impacted and will continue to impact our global asset management business. For example, certain of our asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) , UCITS and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation (PRIIPs). These requirements impact the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the U.K. and EU where we have a substantial asset management business. These international rules, proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities. In addition to regulations noted in this section, within the EU and the U.K. we have been and will continue to address regulatory reforms or structural changes including but not limited to: Sustainable Disclosure Regulation (SDR), U.K. Retail Disclosure framework, AIFMD II, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In addition, although the U.K. has now left the EU, the U.K. regulators may choose to implement future EU regulations and apply them in the U.K. potentially with significant variation from the EU regulations and potentially increasing the complexity and costs for our compliance with divergent sets of rules. Columbia Threadneedle companies or activities are also subject to various local country or jurisdiction regulations and to corresponding regulators in Europe, Canada, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, South America and Australia. With our growth in the EU, we have (and will continue to have) greater engagement with the Luxembourg, Irish and Dutch regulators. Other Securities Regulation Ameriprise Certificate Company is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, Ameriprise Certificate Company must observe certain governance, disclosure, record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division). Ameriprise Trust Company is primarily regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It is prohibited from accepting deposits or making personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the DOL and the Department of Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. Ameriprise Trust Company, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients. Insurance Regulation Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. These regulations impact our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and our closed-blocks 13 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. included in Corporate & Other segment. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and compliance with insurance and securities laws. RiverSource Life Insurance Company is domiciled in Minnesota and regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MN DOC) and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York is domiciled in New York and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NY DFS), together with MN DOC the Domiciliary Regulators. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators. Aspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Retirement & Protection Solutions segment and the closed blocks in our Corporate & Other segment. For example, RiverSource Distributors, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our RiverSource annuities and insurance products sold through Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (AFS) and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA, the SECs best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL are relevant to our insurance and annuities business or products. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines. All states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees (subject to statutory limits) to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies. These assessments are generally based on a member insurers proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurers insolvency. See Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments. Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by the RiverSource Life companies, and certain separate accounts supporting such contracts, constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of Treasury does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework in addition to providing periodic reports to the President of the United States and Congress. We monitor the FIOs activity to identify and assess emerging regulatory priorities with potential application to our business. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (RBC) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance companys total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. The NAIC RBC report is completed as of December 31 and filed annually, along with the statutory financial statements. Our RiverSource Life companies are subject to various levels of regulatory intervention if their total adjusted statutory capital falls below defined RBC action levels. At the company action level, defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2023: Entity Company Action Level RBC Total Adjusted Capital % of Company Action Level RBC (in millions, except percentages) RiverSource Life $ 512 $ 3,093 604 % RiverSource Life of NY 40 244 614 % Ameriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Minnesota and New York (the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled). These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance companys state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure. As part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (Holding Company Act) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding 14 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its ORSA, which is a complete self-assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws were enacted by the Domiciliary Regulators. We complete and file these reports as required by the laws and regulations of those states. Insurance regulation and supervision also goes beyond direct regulation of our insurance companies in other ways. For example, while we will be subject to the FRBs Building Block Approach (discussed below in more detail), once Minnesota implements the NAICs Group Capital Calculation, a new capital calculation will exist for many insurance companies like ours that are not subject to FRB regulation as we are. And from time to time we must report other enterprise activities to our state insurance regulators (such as the NAICs Liquidity Stress Testing Framework). Federal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the OCC, which is the primary regulator of federal savings banks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in its role as insurer of Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As a federally chartered savings bank, Ameriprise Bank is subject to numerous rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices and transactions with affiliates. Ameriprise Bank is also subject to specific capital rules and limits on capital distributions, including payment of dividends. If Ameriprise Bank's capital falls below certain levels, the OCC would be required to take remedial actions and could take other actions, including imposing further limits on dividends or business activities. In addition, an array of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations apply to Ameriprise Bank. As the controlling company of Ameriprise Bank, Ameriprise Financial is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ameriprise Financial has elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the Bank Holding Company Act). Further, FRB regulation and supervisory oversight of Ameriprise Financial includes examinations, regular financial reporting, and prudential standards, such as capital, liquidity risk management, and parameters for business conduct and internal governance. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking, and going beyond these activities would require a conformance period request from the FRB. As a financial holding company, we may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of either a bank holding company (or a bank) without the prior approval of the FRB or of a non-financial company absent an available exemption. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as our sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain well-capitalized and well-managed under applicable regulations, and must receive at least a satisfactory rating in its most recent examination under the CRA. In addition, Ameriprise, as a financial holding company, must remain well-capitalized and well-managed in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the violation and any agreement then reached with the FRB, Ameriprise Financial could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those generally permissible for bank holding companies until such violation is cured. We are subject to what is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including Ameriprise and our affiliates, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, asset management, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, with a number of exemptions and exclusions. It also requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. In October 2023, the FRB issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the Building Block Approach for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities (commonly referred to as insurance savings and loan holding companies). In general, under the final rule, insurance savings and loan holding companies like us are required to aggregate state-based insurance capital requirements with banking capital requirements for non-insurance businesses to satisfy specific minimum total requirements and hold an additional capital conservation buffer. The rule is effective January 1, 2024, with reporting to the FRB beginning in 2025 and delayed effectiveness for certain provisions. Additional Parent Company Regulation and Other Regulation Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls and corporate governance. The adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act significantly enhanced those rules and regulations. We have operations in a number of geographical regions across the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Certain states enact regulations or requirements that can drive enterprise-wide action or disclosures. We evaluate these laws and changes to understand if and when they 15 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. impact our business, such as the new law in California requiring certain climate disclosure. As an international company, we continuously monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates global supervision and prudential regulation of certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities. Privacy, Environmental and Anti-Money Laundering Laws Many aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information, from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws and regulations such as the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, and California privacy legislation, as recently amended, EU data protection legislation, known as the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as implemented in the respective EU member states, the U.K. Data Protection Act, 2018 and U.K. GDPR, and data protection rules in other regions in which we operate outside the U.S. and the EU. We have also implemented policies and procedures in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and best serve our clients. To the extent we do experience an incident, we have developed and implemented a cybersecurity incident response manual, which we regularly exercise and update, as appropriate. As the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct certain air and water reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and support our compliance with these laws and regulations. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001. It substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs, including enhancing our know your customer and due diligence programs. We continuously review, update and enhance our anti-money laundering procedures and programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the U.K. derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

Risk Factors Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know. However, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Market Risks Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political and other factors. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors. Such factors, which can be global, regional, national or local in nature, include: (i) the level and volatility of the markets, including equity prices, interest rates, commodity prices, currency values and other market indices and drivers; (ii) geopolitical strain, terrorism and armed conflicts, (iii) political dynamics or elections and social, economic and market conditions; (iv) the availability and cost of capital; (v) global health emergencies (such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic); (vi) technological changes and 16 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. events; (vii) U.S. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; (viii) U.S. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; (ix) the availability and cost of credit and hedge markets; (x) periods of elevated inflation; (xi) natural disasters such as weather catastrophes; and (xii) other factors affecting investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives or to pay dividends or otherwise return capital from our subsidiaries to our holding company. Declines and volatility in U.S. and global market conditions (such as those that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic environment, from other recent geopolitical tensions or from situations like the 2023 regional bank crisis) have impacted our businesses in the past, are impacting us now and may continue to impact us in the same, new or different ways in the future. Our businesses have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by U.S. and global capital market and credit crises, the repricing of credit risk, equity market volatility and decline, and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally. Each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. It is difficult to predict when, how long and to what extent the aforementioned adverse conditions will exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will be directly affected and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions. As a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These factors will also impact client behavior. Market downturns, stagnation, and volatility may cause, and have caused, individual investors to limit or decrease their participation in global markets negatively impacting our retail business and/or our product sales. Market conditions, regulatory actions, tax laws, and our competitive industry environment are among the reasons current shareholders in our mutual funds, OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts, investment trusts and other pooled investment vehicles, contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products may opt to withdraw cash values for those products (or for certain protection products, to reduce their withdrawal activity). If we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility, our sales and management fee revenues could decline. Downturns and volatility in markets (including equity, fixed income, real estate, alternatives such as infrastructure and private equity and other markets) have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, retail advisory accounts, variable annuity contracts, banking products and other products. Because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the Columbia Management family of mutual funds which are terminable on 60 days notice. Although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks, institutional and individual clients can generally terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. Further, a number of the products and services we make available to our clients are those offered by third parties and negative perceptions of these financial products and services (or the financial industry in general) may impact the number of withdrawals and redemptions or reduce purchases made by our clients, which would adversely impact the levels of our assets under management. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, active or passive investing styles or the proliferation of exchange traded funds (ETFs) or other vehicles like separately managed accounts (SMAs)), changes in our (or our advisors) reputation in the marketplace, a clients view of ESG factors, changes in client or relationship management, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. This reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and a majority of our variable annuity products in force contain guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits. Decline or volatility in equity and/or bond markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Discontinuing the sale of new fixed annuities and variable annuities with living benefits will lessen this risk over time. Although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity and/or bond market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. For example, market fluctuations will impact our statutory reserves and required capital, and that may not be aligned with the hedging impacts. Further, the cost of hedging our liability for these guarantees has increased as a result of broad-based market and regulatory-driven changes in the collateral requirements of hedge trading counterparties. Changes in interest rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our insurance, annuity, investment products, wrap fees and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations (inclusive of changes in credit spreads), which could cause future impacts associated with such fluctuations to differ from our 17 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. historical costs. In addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products, something we saw as a result of volatility that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations, significant changes in interest rates (or prolonged periods of low interest rates) could have a material adverse impact on the profitability of certain products or product lines or our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, as rates increase, the posting of collateral for liquidity needs will also increase as a result of the hedging of variable annuity products. Depending on how rapidly rates increase and other factors, we may need to access liquidity sources that are more costly, which could have a material adverse impact on profitability or our results of operations or financial condition. Interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. During periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases and we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to reinvest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments. If there is a return to a period of prolonged low interest rates, our spread may be reduced or could become negative. Due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as long term care and universal life with secondary guarantees as well as guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in or stagnancy of low long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. We periodically review and, where appropriate, adjust our assumptions. As market interest rates increase or sustain at relatively higher rates, we may credit clients higher rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance, face-amount certificates, and banking products and we may increase these rates on in force products to keep these products competitive (which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations). Because yields on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, increases in market interest rates would further increase the unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may cause outflows and other negative impacts through increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, or changes in demands of certain bank or certificate products as policyholders, contractholders and clients seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from many different areas of our business. These withdrawals, surrenders and other client actions may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in investment losses to be realized in our results of operations. Also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings in the period. If higher market interest rates lead to inflows into interest-sensitive products (such as face-amount certificates and certain banking products) or other changes in product behavior, our capital requirements may increase as well. Adverse capital and credit market conditions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital. Volatility, uncertainty and disruption in the capital and credit markets may decrease available liquidity, which we may need to pay our expenses and dividends. If the market conditions hinder our availability to obtain capital or liquidity, our business could suffer. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and the cash generated by our operations. We believe the level of cash and securities we maintain, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. In the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may access financing sources such as our committed unsecured revolving credit facility or other bank debt. Additional financing depends on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, actions by our regulators, and perceptions held by shareholders, customers or lenders. Further, the financial strength ratings which various rating organizations publish as a measure of an insurance companys ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintain public confidence in our products, our competitive position, and the ability to market our products. Any future downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could potentially have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: (i) reducing new sales of insurance and annuity products and investment products; (ii) adversely affecting our relationships with our advisors and third-party distributors of our products; (iii) materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; (iv) requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and (v) adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance. Ratings agencies have and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations models for maintenance of ratings levels (including adjusting the framework under which they view our Companys business mix that drives these requirements), or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes 18 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. of securities or types of institutions, and our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the rating organizations. In addition, rating agencies continually evolve their ratings and other methodologies, and these changes can be to our detriment or benefit and have a material impact on how we view our liquidity and capital. Market conditions or decisions by our ratings agencies that hinder our access to capital may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital targets, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Business Risks Intense competition and the economies of scale for larger competitors could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries, including broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial institutions, some of which have a larger market share, greater investments in technology and analytics, greater investment in advertising and brand, less regulation or greater financial resources than we do. Furthermore, our competitors may be better able to address trends, structural changes, or movement of assets resulting from industry changes or in response to the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. and around the world. We could experience lower sales, higher costs, technology obsolescence or other developments that could negatively impact our results of operations. A drop in our investment performance as compared to that of our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services. Strong investment performance supports the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates opportunities for new sales of products and services. It may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as Morningstar or Lipper, which may compound the foregoing effects. Strong investment performance and its effects are important elements to our stated goals of growing assets under management and greater economies of scale. There can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns. Any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of institutional asset management relationships. These impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. Further, any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our advisors or through third party intermediaries, may further reduce profits as sales of other companies mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent. Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract, motivate, engage and retain qualified people in a very competitive market. While we are seeing the employment market stabilize compared to recent years, the financial services industry has always been a highly competitive industry. Fewer individuals entering the labor force, increased demand for flexibility and fully remote work, and wage sensitivity due to the inflationary environment put pressure on labor costs and add complexity in recruiting and retaining talent. We continue to assess risk and invest in our employees to remain competitive and have continued to diversify our geographic footprint, however, we also recognize that the possibility of increased turnover may impact our ability to attract, support and retain clients and advisors. We are also dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business (and for a significant portion of the sales of our products) and recruiting and retaining financial advisors is highly competitive and ever-changing. In addition, the investment performance of our asset management products and services, and the retention of our products and services by our clients, are dependent upon the strategies and decisions of our portfolio managers and analysts. From time to time there are regulatory-driven or other trends and developments within the industry, such as changes around the Protocol for Broker Recruiting or the recent proposal by the Federal Trade Commission (and similar state proposals and general scrutiny) around non-competition or non-solicitation agreements, that could potentially impact the dynamics between us and our competitors or negatively impact our business. If employees or advisors who maintain relationships with our clients leave, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and our clients may choose to leave for a competitor. If we experience a prolonged inability to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. The negative performance or default by other financial institutions or other third parties could adversely affect us. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurers, reinsurers, investment funds and other institutions. The operations of U.S. and global financial services institutions are interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults, limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses. While we regularly assess our exposure to different industries 19 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and counterparties, the performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change, the timing and extent of which cannot be known. Many transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. With respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. We also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions (including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits), reinsurance, repurchase and underwriting arrangements and equity investments. Any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Issuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. Some of our fixed maturity securities may have ratings below investment-grade. Default-related declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions. Capital and credit market volatility or a sudden devaluation of a specific product or security (such as the broad impacts experienced from the 2023 regional bank crisis) can exacerbate, and has exacerbated, the risk of third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients access to cash and investments. Although we are not required to do so, we have elected in the past, and we may elect in the future, to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events, provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage, or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage. If we elect to provide additional support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. These losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. If we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels and the sale of unaffiliated products may diminish sales of our own products. We distribute many of our investment products through unaffiliated third-party advisors and financial institutions. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy, as strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products or service our clients and to increase our assets under management, revenues and profitability. Access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory industry as well as regulatory and consumer trends driving escalating compliance, disclosure and risk management requirements for distributors. Relationships with our distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of our products marketed. As a result, there can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue. Any such reduction in access to (or the economics associated with) third-party distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management segments. Further, any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability. The sale of third-party products to our clients (and further expansion of our advisor networks product suite to include additional products of unaffiliated insurance companies and asset managers) may lower sales of our companies own products, lead to higher surrenders or redemptions, or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. Fixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. The determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable, and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, current interest rates and credit spreads, and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates and rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, the valuation of certain securities may 20 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. require additional subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable and may require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated, which may result in values less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unexpected credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The determination of the amount of allowances taken on certain loans and investments is subject to managements evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. The determination of the amount of allowances varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class. Management uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. The determination of the amount of allowances on loans is based upon the assets expected life, considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. Some of our investments are relatively illiquid and we may have difficulty selling these investments. We invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities, mortgage loans, and limited partnership interests, all of which are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented 7% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance Risks The failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds. Our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. Uncertainty and volatility in the U.S. economy and financial markets in recent years have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receivership, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments upon order of liquidation. If the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We use reinsurance to mitigate certain of our risks. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers, including Commonwealth and Genworth Life Insurance Company. In July 2016, we finalized various confidential enhancements with Genworth Life Insurance Company that have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our Domiciliary Regulators and rating agencies. A reinsurers insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time. The assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. We monitor our reserve levels continually. If we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance profitability relies on our assumptions including those regarding morbidity rates, mortality rates and benefit utilization as well as the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts. We set prices for RiverSource insurance products (and historically LTC insurance) as well as some annuity products based upon expected claims payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, including expenses, fees, investment returns, and morbidity and mortality rates. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. Actual experience can differ from our assumptions for many reasons over the time an insurance product is held. If mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make 21 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected. The prices and profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency (the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next). For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. For our LTC insurance, universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees and variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. The risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our LTC insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. Though we discontinued offering LTC products in 2003, LTC insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years. Our ability to forecast future claim rates for LTC insurance is more limited than life insurance. We have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring LTC policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present stand-alone LTC insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases and provided reduced benefit options on certain in force policies. Because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. Additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. Moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily LTC insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Operations Risks A failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses. Our reputation is one of our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Reputational damage may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, clients or potential clients perceived failure of how we address certain political, environmental, social or governance topics, technological breakdowns, cybersecurity attacks, or other security breaches (including attempted breaches, breaches impacting our vendors or their subcontractors or inadvertent disclosures) resulting in system unavailability, improper disclosure or loss of data integrity relating to client or employee personal information, unethical or improper behavior and the misconduct or error of our employees, advisors and counterparties. Additionally, a failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and potentially expose us to additional costs, or negative public relations or social media campaigns. Any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental audits or investigations or litigation. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Misconduct by our employees and advisors may be difficult to detect and deter and may damage our reputation. This can include improper use of their authorized access to sensitive information. Misconduct or errors by our employees and advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct or mistakes can occur in each of our businesses. We cannot always prevent misconduct by our employees and advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Preventing and detecting misconduct among our franchisee advisors who are not employees of our company presents additional challenges in that they control their own technology environment on a day-to-day basis and could have an adverse effect on our business. Our reputation depends on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest. We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest, though our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately. In addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators, as well as foreign regulators, have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the actions we may be expected to take when a conflict is encountered. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Also, it is possible that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions with us or in certain products or services we offer, which would adversely affect our businesses. 22 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. The direct and indirect effects of climate change could adversely affect our business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on our clients, counterparties and entities whose securities we hold. We operate in many regions, countries and communities around the world where our business, and the activities of our clients and counterparties, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change may increase the severity and frequency of weather-related catastrophes, or adversely affect our investment portfolio or investor sentiment. This includes the potential for an increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics. In addition, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold, or our willingness to continue to hold their securities. Climate change may also influence investor sentiment with respect to the Company and investments in our portfolio and those available to clients through third-parties. It may also impact other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulation is implemented in the many regions where we operate, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect. Transition risks may arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Overall, we cannot predict or estimate the long-term impacts on us from climate change or related regulation. Our operational systems and networks (as well as those of our franchise advisors and third parties) are subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, loss of our proprietary information, damage to our reputation, additional costs to us, regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts. Our business is reliant upon internal and third-party-controlled, developed and operated software (which includes opensource software), technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including our current, potential and former clients, employees and advisors personal information, as well as our proprietary information, and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions. Maintaining the security and integrity of our software, information and these systems and networks, and appropriately responding to any cybersecurity and privacy incidents (including attempts), is critical to the success of our business operations, including our reputation, the retention of our advisors and clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients personal information. We rely on the third parties with whom we do business to identify and remediate software and other vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by bad actors, but they cannot always do so. For example, zero-day vulnerabilities in software and other technology solutions are immediately exploitable by bad actors as occasionally happens with certain of our vendors in the industry. We routinely face attacks and seek to address evolving threats of which we become aware. We have been able to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from these attacks to date without a material loss of client financial assets or information through the use of ongoing internal and external threat monitoring and by making continual adjustments to our security and incident response capabilities. We and our advisors, as well as our service providers and clients, have also been threatened by, among others, phishing, vishing, and spear phishing scams, social engineering attacks (such as direct voice contact and any technology or communication mechanism to contact a person), account takeovers, introductions of malware, attempts at electronic break-ins, and the submission of fraudulent payment requests. The number of threats and events has increased substantially every year, which is expected to continue, particularly as the use of artificial intelligence makes these attempts look more legitimate. Attempted or successful breaches or interference by third parties or by insiders that may occur in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. On a corporate basis, various laws and regulations, and in some cases contractual obligations, require us to establish and maintain corporate policies and technical and operational measures designed to protect sensitive client, employee, contractor and vendor information, and to respond to cybersecurity incidents in certain ways and timeframes. We have established policies and implemented such technical and operational measures ourselves and have in place policies that require our service providers and franchisee advisors, each of which control locally their own technology operations, to do the same. The increase in hybrid working among our employees adds complexity to monitoring and processing procedures. Changes in our business or technological advancements may also require corresponding changes in our systems, networks and data security and response measures. While accessing our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that sit outside of our security control environment. In addition, the ever-increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks (including in recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies), both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats and report incidents they suffer. As these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources (both direct financial resources and indirect costs like people) to enhance or expand upon the technical and operational security and response measures we currently maintain or that we allow franchise advisors to maintain and control locally. These regulator-driven changes may adversely impact the client experience by, for example, requiring multiple means of verifying the identity of a client before they can interact with us. Despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity, privacy and technology risks, we cannot be certain that our systems and networks, or those used by our vendors, will not be subject to successful attacks, breaches or interference. Nor can we guarantee that franchise advisors will comply with our policies and procedures in this regard, or that clients 23 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. will engage in safe and secure online practices. Furthermore, human error occurs from time to time and such mistakes can lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. We have a vendor management process, but at times our software or service providers could push through updates that are not fully disclosed to us (or tested by them) and that could alter the control posture of their products. Any such event may result in operational disruptions, as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of, our proprietary information or client, employee, vendor, or advisor personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to respond to, eliminate, or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or advisors, or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, it may not protect us against all cybersecurity- or privacy-related losses. Furthermore, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if we breach any confidentiality or security obligations regarding vendor data or for losses related to the data. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general-public notification of such incidents, including those where our vendors are the party being breached, could exacerbate the harm to our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations in the event of a breach. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data and conduct appropriate incident response, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks, as well as the adoption, implementation and maintenance of appropriate security measures. In addition, our regulators may seek to hold our company responsible for the acts, mistakes or omissions of our vendors or franchise advisors even where they procure and control much of the physical office space and technology infrastructure they use to operate their businesses locally. Protection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business. If we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems, or other failure in operational execution, it could harm our business. Operating errors and system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our operations. Interruptions could be caused by mistake, malfeasance or other operational failures by service provider staff, employee or advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, maintenance of existing technology, or natural disasters, each of which may impact our ability to run our systems or encounter varying downtime. Though we plan for resiliency in our systems and test these capabilities, we could face additional downtime or data loss if our plans do not work as expected during a real event. Our financial, accounting, human resources, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly, experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients (some of which have regulatory required response times). Further, while we require their existence by contract, we cannot control the execution of any business continuity or incident response plans implemented by our service providers or our franchise advisors. We rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications, technology and business functions and other services, and we face the risk of their operational failure (including, without limitation, loss of staff due to widespread illness, failure caused by an inaccuracy, untimeliness or other deficiency in data reporting), technical or security failures, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other third-party service providers that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. These risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products and technological means for interacting with these products or client accounts. Any such failure, termination or constraint or flawed execution or response could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or otherwise achieve desired outcomes. Risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments, products, vendors, or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Many of our methods of managing risk and the associated exposures are based upon our use of observed historical experience or expectations about future experience (e.g., market behavior, client/policyholder behavior, employee behavior, mortality, etc.) or statistics based on historical models. Experience may not emerge as expected and during periods of market volatility, or due to unforeseen events, the historically-derived experience and correlations may not be valid. As a result, these methods and models may not predict future exposures accurately, which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate. Further some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations and we have a general model risk where there is a risk of loss associated with insufficient or inaccurate models that we use to support our decision. This could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Our financial performance also requires us to develop, effectively manage, and market new or existing products and services that appropriately anticipate or respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of Asset Management and other products with a focus on environmental, social and governance matters, require continued innovative effort and may require significant time, resources, and ongoing support. Further, avoiding introducing or encouraging certain new products (such as cryptocurrency) creates the risk of losing assets or new flows to competitors who encourage or support those products. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction and ongoing maintenance of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and 24 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. procedures, shifting and sometimes contradictory client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. Artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence) presents many benefits in terms of operating efficiency, but also new risks that we need to seek to mitigate through our strategic and risk management policies, such as reliance on information that may be inaccurate or biased results. In addition, the regulatory framework and expectations relating to the use of artificial intelligence are in their early stages as is the use (and how we manage the use) of artificial intelligence in our business. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including those associated with our key vendors. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. As a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations. We act as a holding company for our subsidiaries, through which substantially all of our operations are conducted. Dividends and returns of capital from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our borrowings. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment or return of capital and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. If any of this happens, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance, banking and securities laws and regulations, including the FCAs Investment Firms Prudential Regime and the FRBs recent final rules for the Building Block Approach may regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries (such as our insurance, banking and brokerage subsidiaries and our face-amount certificate company) to pay dividends, return capital or make other permitted payments or practically impact our capital structure and dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Additionally, the rating organizations effectively impose various capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. We must manage our business within the expectations of the patchwork of regulations and capital expectations from these parties which are not consistent with one another, use different accounting frameworks (such as GAAP, statutory accounting principles or a mix). A capital action that benefits under one framework may not be beneficial under another framework. As asset values decline or other financial drivers to our business worsen, our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, return capital or make other permitted payments can be reduced. Additionally, the various asset classes held by our subsidiaries, and used in determining required capital levels, are weighted differently or are restricted as to the proportion in which they may be held depending upon their liquidity, credit risk and other factors. The regulatory capital requirements and dividend-paying ability of our subsidiaries may also be affected by a change in the mix of products sold by such subsidiaries. Further, the capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory or rating organization scrutiny and intervention, which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. Additionally, in the past we have found it necessary and advisable to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future. The provision of such support could adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries. The operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in non-U.S. denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with international operations and earnings and income generated overseas. While we are a U.S.-based company, a portion of our business operations occurs outside of the U.S. and some of our investments are not denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar could, and has, unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries. In comparison, depreciation of the U.S. dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, though such depreciation could also diminish investor, creditor and rating organizations perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments. In addition, conducting and increasing our international operations subjects us to additional risks that, generally, we do not face in the U.S., including: (i) potentially adverse cross-border tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; (ii) the localization of our solutions and related costs; (iii) the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different, potentially conflicting legal standards, including laws and regulations; and (iv) social and economic situations outside of the U.S. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and we cannot be certain these operations will produce desired levels of revenues or 25 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. profitability. Our 2021 acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business heightened these risks as it significantly expanded our asset management business in EMEA. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires, blackouts, severe winter weather, explosions, pandemic disease and global health emergencies (such as COVID-19) and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, riots, civil unrest including large-scale protests, insurrections and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities, preventing our service providers, employees and financial advisors from performing their roles, or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims, as described below. These impacts could be particularly severe to the extent they affect access to physical facilities, the physical well-being of large numbers of our employees, our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy or release valuable data. Such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our customers, business counterparties and regulators, as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets. The potential effects of natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following: (i) a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies; (ii) an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries; (iii) widespread unavailability of staff; and (iv) declines and volatility in the financial markets that may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration, which could harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees. We face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures. We have made acquisitions and divestitures (including sales of insurance blocks via reinsurance transactions and other strategic partnerships) in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment (including our risk management policies and procedures), difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, difficulties with the software, technology and systems of the acquired entities that were subject to a different control posture before the acquisition (and until such time as we can replace these or make investments to uplift their capabilities), the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations or expected synergies for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations (such as our 2021 acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business) takes a significant amount of time and attention and incurs both expected and unexpected integration costs over several years. Integrations, particularly larger and more global integrations, are time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business. Risks in divestiture transactions (many of which are present in sales of insurance blocks via reinsurance) include difficulties in the separation of the disposed business, retention of obligations to indemnify for certain liabilities, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to us, if any, and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the disposed business. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the FRB and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may negatively impact our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses. We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. Actions brought against us may result in awards, settlements, penalties, injunctions or other adverse results, including reputational damage. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome. Various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or advisors, were or are deemed to be improper. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical 26 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. of the industries and businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. Our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition. Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. For a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see Business - Regulation included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is expensive, time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. In addition, sometimes these laws and regulations (and potential changes) are in conflict. Further, any future legislation or changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. Legislation could require changes to our business operations or our regulatory reporting relationships which can require significant cost, effort and trade-offs. Such changes may impact our business operations and profitability, increase our costs of doing business, increase compliance costs as well as have a material effect on fee rates, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially impact our products, services, investments, results of operations, products and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. Ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may generate outcomes, the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained as government intervention could distort customary and expected commercial behavior. Certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below. Some of the changes could present operational challenges and increase costs. Ultimately the complexities and increased costs of legislative and regulatory changes could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative products to our clients. Regulation of Products and Services: Any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues and/or earnings. For example, the DOL has proposed changes to regulations that define our advisors relationships with their clients, such as requiring a fiduciary relationship between our advisors and clients for assets held in qualified investment accounts. Insurance Regulation: Changes in the state regulatory requirements applicable to our insurance companies that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation may have on our businesses or competitors, such as the option of federally chartered insurers, a mandated federal systemic risk regulator, future initiatives of the FIO within the Department of the Treasury or by any of the Domiciliary Regulators, the NAIC or the International Association of Insurance Supervisors with respect to insurance holding company supervision, capital standards or systemic risk regulation. As discussed earlier, the FRB has finalized minimum capital requirements which will begin to take effect in 2024. International Regulation: Potential measures taken by foreign and international authorities regarding anti-bribery, the nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, increased environmental sustainability or governance requirements, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations) and in their application or interpretation, imposition of large fines, political instability, capital requirements or dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls, or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies may negatively affect our business. Employment Regulation: We have a global workforce and face expansion of employment laws in various states, cities, and countries. These regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and we seek to provide a uniform employee experience, while simultaneously complying with unique or differing regulatory requirements. A portion of our advisor force consists of independent contractors. Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our industry, our business and our relationships with (and ability to provide various types of support to) our advisors and their staff, resulting in an adverse effect on our results or operations. Privacy, Cybersecurity and Data: Our business is subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information, from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies. This regulatory framework is rapidly changing through an ever-increasing patchwork of state laws and regulation (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act) and international developments like GDPR. Further developments could negatively impact our business and operations. Artificial intelligence and external customer data and information source: Our business is subject to state insurance laws that sets forth regulatory expectations for insurers using artificial intelligence or certain external customer data or information sources. We expect state regulatory activity to rapidly increase in 2024 with the recent adoption of the NAICs Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers. Federal and other regulators (such as the SEC) are also beginning to propose rules around artificial intelligence. These developments as well as other developments could negatively impact our business and operations. 27 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. As a Savings and Loan Holding Company, we are subject to supervision by the FRB and various prudential standards that may limit our activities and strategies. Ameriprise Financial is subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB, including supervision and prudential standards, certain capital requirements, stress-testing, resolution planning, information security and privacy, and certain risk management requirements. Further, as a financial holding company, our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or, with FRB approval, complementary to a financial activity. Our broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. These requirements may hinder our ability to access funds from our subsidiaries. We may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. The federal banking regulators, including the OCC, FRB, FDIC, and SEC (through FINRA) have the authority and under certain circumstances, the obligation, to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ameriprise and its bank subsidiaries. Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies, procedures and practices. Compliance with bank holding company laws and regulations, including the Volcker Rule, impacts the structure and availability of certain of our products and services and our costs in providing those products and services. Costs of compliance may be driven by how these laws and regulations and the scale of Ameriprise Bank evolves over the course of time as well as strategic acquisitions and other growth strategies we pursue in the future. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements could, depending on the violation, limit Ameriprises ability to undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies. Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the FRB and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may negatively impact our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. Changes in corporate tax laws and regulations and changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, as well as adverse determinations regarding the application of such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our earnings and could make some of our products less attractive to clients. We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. In addition, changes to the Internal Revenue Code, state or foreign tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our earnings. Furthermore, guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and others can be critical to the application and impact of new laws and in avoiding unintended impacts from legislation. The jurisdictions we operate in may not always provide clear guidance that is responsive to industry questions and concerns. If guidance is unclear, it could increase our taxes or create a potential for disagreement about interpretation of the tax code. Many of the products we issue or on which our businesses are based (including both insurance products and non-insurance products) receive favorable treatment under current U.S. federal income or estate tax law. Changes in U.S. federal income or estate tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of certain of our products and thus make such products less attractive to clients or cause a change in client demand and activity. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent registrations and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or attempt to use the same to defraud others. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our brand and reputation, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection, or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. We also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon, or constitute misappropriation of, such other partys intellectual property rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services, or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain product features. Any party that holds a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. The threat of patent litigation from non-practicing entities could impact financial services firms and successful resolution could still have a significant financial impact. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial 28 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in and the adoption of accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements. Our accounting policies provide a standard for how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that accounting changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. As an example, in August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standard related to long-duration insurance and annuity contracts that is effective January 1, 2023 and resulted in significant changes to how we account for and report our insurance and annuity contracts (both in force and new business), including updating assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts, measurement of market risk benefits and amortization of DAC. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 1C. Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Cybersecurity is a key part of our business and client experience and is integrated into our enterprise risk management processes and policies. We maintain written policies, processes and procedures that seek to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from known and emerging cybersecurity risks. Our program includes consuming threat intelligence and ongoing monitoring of known external threats. We also have operating policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable requirements in jurisdictions we operate in globally. Our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and internally assessed to enhance our corporate security capabilities. We make ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure to support cybersecurity efforts and support reliability and the user experience. We offer clients and advisors a variety of options to help secure their information, including multi-factor authentication and the use of secure messaging sites. We provide our employees and advisors with ongoing security training and periodically test their skills and understanding with various cybersecurity exercises. We remain vigilant against cybersecurity risks as part of operating our business. Our cybersecurity team is led by experienced staff, including our Chief Information Officer, who has been with the company in various technology positions since 2002. Previously, he worked for other companies holding senior delivery and architecture roles and holds both a bachelors degree in engineering and an MBA. Our Chief Information Security Officer has over 30 years of broad IT experience, with expertise in Information Security. His background also includes systems design and development, and he has expertise in database administration and database platforms across both mainframe and distributed platforms. Prior to joining the company, he worked as a consultant and a developer at other companies. Our risk management approach involves a matrixed structure of leaders who bring various levels of cybersecurity and technology expertise to their areas of risk management. Our technology team relies on their enterprise-wide colleagues expertise when needed to plan, respond, and mitigate incidents. We conduct regular vulnerability scanning and related remediation activities for our applications and systems. We have documented expectations for the patching and updating of our software environment and set similar expectations for our financial advisors and third-party service providers where they retain control of their environment. Our cybersecurity approach supports both business continuity and risk mitigation. Should an incident occur, we have plans in place that are designed to mitigate the impact to our operations while we respond and recover, if necessary. We run a global security operations center that continuously monitors our networks and systems and is prepared to contact the appropriate teams to respond to an incident should one occur. Depending on the incident, the response group may include participation from a wide variety of groups across the enterprise. We conduct regular exercises to verify that our business continuity plans are capable of recovering our operating capabilities in line with our business needs and expectations. In addition, our global privacy team provides oversight and support to business and staff groups in conducting annual risk assessments regarding the secure handling of personally identifiable information. Additionally, as part of our formal procurement and vendor management process, we ask our third-party service providers to have and maintain cybersecurity programs that are consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations, and we review cybersecurity risk assessments of those third-party service providers who provide key technology and services. For third-party service providers that do go through our formal procurement process and vendor risk management assessment, our vendor risk management team assigns tiers. The tiers are based on a combination of criteria, including the services provided and the information to which they have access, to focus the most detailed reviews and the most frequent assessments on highest tiered third-party service providers, while also 29 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. maintaining an appropriate level of review and monitoring on lower tiers. Some third-party service providers contracted outside of the formal procurement process may still be subject to providing information about their security programs based on services performed. Our Vendor Risk Management Office provides oversight and support to the business teams as end-users of the third-party service providers goods and services, while also providing a conduit through which oversight can be conducted by our management and board. When a third-party service provider is off-boarded through our procurement and vendor management process, they are subject to an off-boarding review when the relationship ends that is designed to obtain the return or destruction of our information. Our vendor management teams provide risk assessment reporting to business teams, internal risk management committees and our executive leadership. The reporting structure supports an effective design of the program, provides transparency, and drives regulatory compliance. Third-party service providers that participate in the delivery of services to us, as well as their fourth-parties, are also generally expected to have and maintain cybersecurity defenses, so long as they participate in the delivery of services to us to help protect our systems and our clients from incursions through third-party services systems. Should one of our third-party service providers suffer a breach in their or their fourth-party systems, we rely on them to inform us and work with us to protect our systems, remediate breaches, and mitigate the impact to our clients and our technology. Governance Strong ongoing governance practices and policies support our cybersecurity program. The Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee are central to the oversight of the companys cybersecurity risk management program operated by senior management. In addition to the Audit and Risk Committee receiving quarterly cybersecurity updates, the Audit and Risk Committee discusses with management, the General Auditor, and others the companys enterprise-wide risk assessment and risk management processes. These updates to the Audit and Risk Committee include a review of prevailing material risks and exposures, including cybersecurity and data protection threats and risks, the actions taken to address these threats and mitigate these risks, and the design and effectiveness of our processes and controls in light of evolving market, business, regulatory, and other conditions. Our Audit and Risk Committee has semiannual trainings, to which the full board is also invited, to stay educated on ever-evolving cybersecurity topics. These processes and information sharing enable the Board of Directors, the Audit and Risk Committee, and our management team to remain informed and aligned about our approach to cybersecurity risk, and the monitoring of these risks and incidents, as appropriate. Our executive Vice President of Technology and Chief Information Officer, our Chief Information Security Officer, and other officers regularly review with our Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee topics such as the following: the cyber threat landscape; the design, effectiveness and ongoing enhancement of our capabilities to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from cyber threats and events; and any incidents that merit discussion. During 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed our identity theft prevention and privacy programs and discussed, among other topics: mandatory staff training on fraud prevention, including threats from social engineering, identity theft experience and trends; the effectiveness of existing controls and planned enhancements to those controls; and key areas of focus for the identity theft and privacy programs. Item 2. Properties We operate our business from two principal locations, both of which are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota: the Ameriprise Financial Center, a 959,000 square foot building that we lease, and our Client Service Center, an 871,000 square foot building, that we own. In 2023, we started the process to consolidate our Minneapolis office footprint, and we plan to move all our Minneapolis based employees to our Client Service Center by 2025. Generally, we lease the premises we occupy in other locations, including the 38,000 square foot executive offices that we lease in New York City and branch offices for our employee advisors throughout the U.S. Our other principal leases are in the following locations:  Columbia Threadneedle occupies 82,000 square feet of offices in Boston. Columbia Threadneedle also leases approximately 66,000 square feet of a shared building in London plus an additional 60,000 square feet in three shared buildings in London (as well as additional locations in Swindon, U.K., Dorking, U.K. and Edinburgh, U.K.), approximately 39,000 square feet of a shared building in New York and also leases property in a number of other cities to support its global operations;  Las Vegas, Nevada (supporting aspects of our Advice & Wealth Management businesses) and Gurugram and Noida India (supporting our broader business in the U.S. and globally).  We recently opened a Charlotte, North Carolina location in a 53,000 square feet space that we lease for corporate and business support. We believe that the facilities owned or occupied by our company suit our needs and are well maintained. Item 3.

. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that follow and the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to Ameriprise Financial, Ameriprise, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. Overview Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a nearly 130-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.4 trillion in assets under management and administration as of December 31, 2023. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients financial objectives. For additional discussion of our businesses, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships. We operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, pandemics, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - Risk Factors - and other factors as discussed herein. Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits and embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the spread income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. We have been operating in a historically low interest rate environment but have recently experienced a substantial increase in rates with uncertainty about where rates will go in the future. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the third quarter, we conducted our annual review of life insurance, annuity and long term care (LTC) valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates are collectively referred to as unlocking. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking. On July 13, 2023, we announced that we withdrew our application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB (Ameriprise Bank) to a state-chartered industrial bank and our application to establish a new limited purpose national trust bank. Ameriprise Bank will continue to operate as it does today, regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These changes are not expected to impact our long-term growth strategy for Ameriprise Bank and we will continue to offer our strong lineup of banking solutions, including deposits, credit cards, mortgages and securities-based lending to our wealth management clients without interruption. We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (CIEs). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in Net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the Management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. While our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (UL) insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (VUL) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to 32 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiaries nonperformance spread. In the first quarter of 2023, management introduced an adjusted capital measure (Available Capital for Capital Adequacy), which management believes best reflects the available capital resources of our operations and facilitates a meaningful trend analysis. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy adjusts GAAP total equity and excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI); goodwill and intangibles; RiverSource Life Insurance Companys GAAP equity excluding AOCI; and includes RiverSource Life Insurance Companys statutory total adjusted capital prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Minnesota Department of Commerce; and other adjustments, primarily certain deferred tax balances. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Managements Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. Concurrent with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , management no longer excludes adjustments for deferred acquisition costs (DAC), deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) and unearned revenue amortization from adjusted operating earnings measures. Amortization of DAC, DSIC, and unearned revenue is no longer impacted by markets and is now amortized on a constant-level basis in accordance with GAAP. It is managements priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. Our financial targets are:  Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and  Adjusted operating return on equity of over 30%. The following table reconciles our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures: Per Diluted Share Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions, except per share amounts) Net income $ 2,556 $ 3,149 $ 23.71 $ 27.70 Less Adjustments: Net realized investment gains (losses) (1) (32) (93) (0.30) (0.82) Market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (1) (608) 483 (5.63) 4.25 Mean reversion related impacts (1)  (1)  (0.01) Integration/restructuring charges (1) (62) (50) (0.58) (0.44) Net income (loss) attributable to CIEs  (4)  (0.04) Tax effect of adjustments (2) 147 (71) 1.36 (0.61) Adjusted operating earnings $ 3,111 $ 2,885 $ 28.86 $ 25.37 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 105.7 111.3 Diluted 107.8 113.7 (1) Pretax adjusted operating adjustments.

Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our accounting policies. Valuation of Investments The most significant component of our investments is our Available-for-Sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the fair value of our Available-for-Sale securities. Financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate Available-for-Sale portfolio. Changes to these assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs. 34 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Market Risk Benefits Market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on variable annuity products that provide minimum guarantees to policyholders. Guarantees accounted for as market risk benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB). Variable Annuities We have approximately $81 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. The diversified variable annuity block consists of $37 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $44 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily GMWB provisions. The business is predominately issued through the Ameriprise Financial  advisor network. The majority of the variable annuity contracts currently offered by us contain GMDB provisions. We discontinued most new sales of GMWB and GMAB at the end of 2021 and new sales were completely discontinued as of mid-2022. We also previously offered contracts containing GMIB provisions. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts. In determining the assets or liabilities for market risk benefits, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, surrenders (also referred to as persistency), benefit utilization and investment margins. Management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. Unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year. In addition, the valuation of market risk benefits is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread over the U.S. Treasury curve widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. The change in fair value due to changes in our nonperformance risk is recorded in other comprehensive income. Regarding the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, changes to reserves due to behavioral risk are driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. We have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. A significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. On a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. Experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. The ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in detecting changes in policyholder behavior. At least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our market risk benefit reserves. The variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. Differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing managements assumptions used in market risk benefit calculations. The extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. Changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. Future Policy Benefits and Claims We establish reserves to cover the benefits associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable and structured variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life insurance, whole life insurance, disability income (DI) and LTC insurance and life contingent payout annuity products. UL and VUL policies with product features that result in profits followed by losses are accounted for as insurance liabilities. The portion of structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and indexed universal life (IUL) policies allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative. The establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. If actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required. Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products, including Embedded Derivatives UL and VUL A portion of our UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to 35 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined at the reporting date using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to client asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees. Embedded Derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives related to structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL fluctuates based on equity markets and interest rates and is reported within our total liabilities. In addition, the valuation of embedded derivatives is impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread over the U.S. Treasury curve widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. Traditional Long-Duration Products The liabilities for traditional long-duration products include cash flows related to unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, DI, LTC, and life contingent payout annuity policies as claims are incurred in the future. Accordingly, the claim liability (also referred to as disabled life reserves) is presented together as one liability for future policy benefits. A liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. Expected insurance benefits are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to premium revenue recognized (referred to as the net premium approach). The net premium ratio reflects cash flows from contract inception to contract termination (i.e., through the claim paying period) and cannot exceed 100%. The liability for future policy benefits is updated for actual experience at least on an annual basis and concurrent with changes to cash flow assumptions. When net premiums are updated for cash flow changes, the estimated cash flows over the entire life of a group of contracts are updated using historical experience and updated future cash flow assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement, sensitivities in reported amounts, offsetting impacts, or future impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements over time or in any given future period. The cash flows used in the calculation are discounted using the forward rate curve on the original contract issue date. The discount rate represents an upper-medium-grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield (i.e., an A rating) that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available. We are unable to predict impacts and determine sensitivities in reported amounts reflecting such market movements on our aggregate derivative portfolio. Changes to assumptions do not occur in isolation and it is impracticable to predict such impacts at the individual security unit of measure which are predominately Level 2 fair value and based on observable inputs. For further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see Note 2, Note 16 and Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Sources of Revenues and Expenses Management and Financial Advice Fees Management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. Management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. Management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees. 36 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Distribution Fees Distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). Distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and UL and VUL insurance. Distribution fees also include revenue for placing clients deposits in its brokerage sweep program with third-party banks as well as revenue from brokerage clients for the execution of requested trades. Net Investment Income Net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as Available-for-Sale, mortgage loans, policy loans, margin loans, pledged asset lines of credit, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of CIEs; the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of CIEs; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; realized gains and losses on the sale of investments; and changes for the allowance for credit losses. Premiums, Policy and Contract Charges Premiums include premiums on traditional life, DI and LTC insurance and payout annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums. Policy and contract charges include variable annuity rider charges and UL and VUL insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for UL and VUL insurance products) and administrative charges. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include the accretion on the fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivables and other miscellaneous revenues. Banking and Deposit Interest Expense Banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates and banking deposits. Distribution Expenses Distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers. The portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract issued by the RiverSource Life companies are deferred. The amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. The majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. Distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. The majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. Distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs. Interest Credited to Fixed Accounts Interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with UL and VUL insurance and annuity contracts. The changes in fair value of fixed deferred indexed annuity and IUL embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are also included within Interest credited to fixed accounts. Benefits, Claims, Losses and Settlement Expenses Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. Amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses exclude the impact of remeasurement of future policy benefit reserves, which is separately presented. The changes in fair value of structured variable annuity embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging this benefit, as well as the amortization of DSIC are also included in Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Remeasurement (Gains) Losses of Future Policy Benefit Reserves Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves represents changes to the net premium ratio for actual versus expected experience and updates to cash flow assumptions used to measure traditional long-duration and limited-payment insurance contracts. Change in Fair Value of Market Risk Benefits Change in fair value of market risk benefits includes the change in fair value of GMDB, GMIB, GMWB and GMAB as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging these market risk benefits. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits are recognized in net income each period with the exception of the portion of the change in fair value due to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). Amortization of DAC Direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as DAC are amortized over time. DAC are amortized on a constant-level basis for the grouped contracts over the expected contract term to approximate straight-line amortization. 37 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and CIE debt, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, such as financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.

Assets Under Management and Administration Assets under management (AUM) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. Assets under administration (AUA) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. AUM and AUA do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Years Ended December 31, Change 2023 2022 (in millions) Revenues Management and financial advice fees $ 8,907 $ 9,033 $ (126) (1) % Distribution fees 1,931 1,939 (8)  Net investment income 3,206 1,474 1,732 NM Premiums, policy and contract charges 1,539 1,397 142 10 Other revenues 513 491 22 4 Total revenues 16,096 14,334 1,762 12 Banking and deposit interest expense 561 76 485 NM Total net revenues 15,535 14,258 1,277 9 Expenses Distribution expenses 5,078 4,935 143 3 Interest credited to fixed accounts 654 665 (11) (2) Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 1,350 242 1,108 NM Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves (20) 1 (21) NM Change in fair value of market risk benefits 798 311 487 NM Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 246 252 (6) (2) Interest and debt expense 324 198 126 64 General and administrative expense 3,871 3,723 148 4 Total benefits and expenses 12,301 10,327 1,974 19 Pretax income 3,234 3,931 (697) (18) Income tax provision 678 782 (104) (13) Net income $ 2,556 $ 3,149 $ (593) (19) % NM Not Meaningful - variance equal to or greater than 100%. Overall Pretax income decreased $697 million, or 18%, for 2023 compared to the prior year. The following impacts were significant drivers of the year-over-year change in pretax income:  The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products, net of hedges was an expense of $608 million for 2023 compared to a benefit of $483 million for the prior year.  The unfavorable impact of unlocking was $99 million for 2023 compared to a favorable impact of unlocking of $133 million for the prior year.  A favorable impact from the trend in rising interest rates on the investment portfolio yield, including from investment portfolio repositioning in our insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022, along with higher balances in bank and certificate products. 39 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to our annual assumption updates, referred to as unlocking, for the years ended December 31: Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 (in millions) Premiums, policy and contract charges $ 1 $ (1) Total revenues 1 (1) Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (17) 7 Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves: LTC unlocking (5) (6) Unlocking impact, excluding LTC (6) 6 Total remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves (11)  Change in fair value of market risk benefits 128 (139) Amortization of DAC  (2) Total benefits and expenses 100 (134) Pretax income (loss) (1) $ (99) $ 133 (1) Includes a $2 million net expense related to the market impact on IUL benefits for 2022, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking. The primary drivers of the year-over-year unlocking impact include the following items:  We lowered our surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense in 2023.  Interest rate assumptions resulted in a benefit in 2022, partially offset by lower surrender assumptions and updated mortality assumptions for variable annuities with living benefits. Net Revenues Management and financial advice fees decreased $126 million, or 1%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the cumulative impact of Asset Management and variable annuity net outflows, partially offset by continued wrap account net inflows. Net investment income increased $1.7 billion for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to the following impacts:  The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and certificate business as a result of the market environment and our strategic decision to continue to invest in these businesses.  The favorable impact of the trend in rising interest rates on the investment portfolio yield, including from investment portfolio repositioning in our insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The favorable impact of higher net investment income of CIEs.  Net realized investment losses of $27 million for 2023 compared to net realized investment losses of $87 million for the prior year. Net realized investment losses for 2023 and 2022 were primarily driven by the fixed maturity investment portfolio repositioning in response to market conditions. Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $142 million, or 10%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. Banking and deposit interest expense increased $485 million for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher average crediting rates and higher average volumes on certificates and Ameriprise Bank cash deposits. Expenses Distribution expenses increased $143 million, or 3%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, as well as investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $11 million, or 2%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  A $28 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $15 million for 2023 compared to a favorable impact of $13 million for the prior year.  A $17 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $34 million for 2023 compared to an expense of $51 million for the prior year. The decrease in expense was primarily due to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior year, which reflected higher option costs due to a higher new money rate, offset by more discounting due to higher Treasury rates.  A decrease in expense driven by variable annuity net outflows. 40 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $1.1 billion for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  An $824 million increase in expense from market impacts on structured variable annuities (SVA) embedded derivative, net of hedging activity. This increase was the result of a favorable $955 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $1.8 billion change in the market impact on the SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the 2023 compared to a benefit in the prior year.  The impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities and increased volume in SVAs. Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased $487 million for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  The impact of unlocking was an expense of $128 million for 2023 primarily reflecting the impact of lower surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits compared to a benefit of $139 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of interest rate assumptions, partially offset by continued lower surrender assumptions and updated mortality assumptions for variable annuities with living benefits.  A $191 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $132 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and an unfavorable $59 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:  Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for 2023 compared to an expense in the prior year.  Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower benefit for 2023 compared to the prior year.  Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for 2023 compared to the prior year.  Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net expense for 2023 compared to the prior year. Interest and debt expense increased $126 million, or 64%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher interest expense of CIEs and the issuance of $750 million of unsecured senior notes in March 2023 and $600 million of unsecured senior notes in November 2023, partially offset by the maturity of $750 million of unsecured senior notes in October 2023. General and administrative expense increased $148 million, or 4%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a $50 million accrual for a regulatory matter relating to electronic communication recordkeeping requirements, increased severance expense related to our expense management initiatives, $12 million of higher integration related expenses, higher volume related expenses and investments for business growth and a larger unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation due to share price appreciation. A portion of the higher integration related expenses was driven by the consolidation of the majority of our London-based teams into a single location following the acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 21.0% for 2023 compared to 19.9% for the prior year. See Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.

Variable annuity sales decreased 1% to $4.0 billion for 2023 compared to the prior year reflecting a decrease in sales of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees, mostly offset by an increase in sales of SVAs. Account values with living benefit riders declined to 54% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 57% a year ago reflecting our actions to optimize our business mix. This trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of business away from products with living benefit guarantees over time. Net Revenues Management and financial advice fees decreased $53 million, or 7%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting variable annuity net outflows. Distribution fees decreased $20 million, or 5%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower sales.

Corporate & Other The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis: Years Ended December 31, Change 2023 2022 (in millions) Revenues Distribution fees $ 1 $  $ 1  % Net investment income 247 155 92 59 % Premiums, policy and contract charges 96 99 (3) (3) Other revenues 209 230 (21) (9) Total revenues 553 484 69 14 Banking and deposit interest expense 20 5 15 NM Total net revenues 533 479 54 11 Expenses Distribution expenses (10) (10)   Interest credited to fixed accounts 234 242 (8) (3) Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 236 247 (11) (4) Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves (1)  (1)  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 11 10 1 10 Interest and debt expense 97 70 27 39 General and administrative expense 286 226 60 27 Total expenses 853 785 68 9 Adjusted operating loss $ (320) $ (306) $ (14) (5) % NM Not Meaningful - variance equal to or greater than 100%. Our Corporate & Other segment includes our closed blocks of LTC insurance and fixed annuity and fixed indexed annuity (FA) business. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact on fixed annuity benefits (net of hedges), the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts, gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased $14 million, or 5%, for 2023 compared to the prior year, reflecting higher severance expense. LTC insurance had pretax adjusted operating earnings of $29 million for 2023 compared to pretax adjusted operating loss of $10 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the benefit of investment portfolio repositioning and higher interest rates on cash positions compared to the prior year. FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $29 million for 2023 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $22 million for the prior year. Fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 12% to $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year as policies continue to lapse and we previously discontinued new sales of fixed deferred annuities. Net Revenues Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs, increased $92 million, or 59%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the benefit of investment portfolio repositioning and higher interest rates on cash positions. Other revenues decreased $21 million, or 9%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from reinsurance transactions. 48 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Expenses Interest and debt expense increased $27 million, or 39%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the issuance of $750 million of unsecured senior notes in March 2023 and $600 million of unsecured senior notes in November 2023, partially offset by the maturity of $750 million of unsecured senior notes in October 2023. General and administrative expense, which excludes integration and restructuring charges and expenses attributable to CIEs, increased $60 million, or 27%, for 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased severance expense related to our expense management initiatives and a larger unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expense due to share price appreciation. Closed Block LTC Insurance As of December 31, 2023, our nursing home indemnity LTC block had approximately $68 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.4 billion, net of reinsurance, which was 51% of GAAP reserves. This block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 84 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 89. Fifty-four percent of daily benefits in force in this block are lifetime benefits. As of December 31, 2023, our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block had approximately $113 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance. This block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity LTC policies. The average attained age is 79 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 86. Thirty-four percent of daily benefits in force in this block are lifetime benefits. We utilize three primary levers to manage our LTC business. First, we have taken an active approach of steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 251% on our nursing home indemnity LTC block (excluding home care riders) and 154% on our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block as of December 31, 2023. Second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. As of December 31, 2023, we had 43,000 policies that were closed with claim activity, as well as 8,000 open claims. We apply this experience to our in force policies, which were 80,000 as of December 31, 2023, at a very granular level by issue year, attained age and benefit features. Our statutory reserves are $265 million higher than our GAAP reserves and include margins on key assumptions for morbidity and mortality, as well as $345 million in asset adequacy reserves as of December 31, 2023. Lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio primarily through a liquid, investment grade portfolio. We undertake an extensive review of the cash flow and expense assumptions supporting the liability for future policy benefits annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using current best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. Our annual review process includes an analysis of our key reserve assumptions, including those for morbidity, terminations (mortality and lapses), and premium rate increases. 49 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 (in millions) Revenues Management and financial advice fees $ 9,033 $ 9,275 $ (242) (3) % Distribution fees 1,939 1,828 111 6 Net investment income 1,474 1,683 (209) (12) Premiums, policy and contract charges 1,397 221 1,176 NM Other revenues 491 382 109 29 Total revenues 14,334 13,389 945 7 Banking and deposit interest expense 76 12 64 NM Total net revenues 14,258 13,377 881 7 Expenses Distribution expenses 4,935 5,028 (93) (2) Interest credited to fixed accounts 665 600 65 11 Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 242 (156) 398 NM Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves 1 (52) 53 NM Change in fair value of market risk benefits 311 (113) 424 NM Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 252 259 (7) (3) Interest and debt expense 198 191 7 4 General and administrative expense 3,723 3,435 288 8 Total expenses 10,327 9,192 1,135 12 Pretax income 3,931 4,185 (254) (6) Income tax provision 782 768 14 2 Net income $ 3,149 $ 3,417 $ (268) (8) % NM Not Meaningful - variance equal to or greater than 100%. Overall Pretax income decreased $254 million, or 6%, for 2022 compared to the prior year. The following impacts were significant drivers of the year-over-year change in pretax income:  The prior year impact of the block transfer reinsurance transaction resulted in $524 million of pretax income for 2021 primarily reflecting the net realized gains on investments sold to the reinsurer.  A negative impact from lower average equity markets compared to the prior year. Our average WEI, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, decreased 7% in 2022 compared to the prior year. The average S&P 500 index was 4% lower for 2022 compared to the prior year.  The favorable impact of unlocking was $133 million for 2022 compared to an unfavorable impact of $113 million for the prior year.  A favorable impact from the increase in short-term interest rates compared to the prior year.  The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was a benefit of $483 million for 2022 compared to a benefit of $464 million for the prior year. 50 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition for the years ended December 31: Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 (in millions) Premiums, policy and contract charges $ (1) $ 16 Total revenues (1) 16 Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 7 6 Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves: LTC unlocking (6)  Unlocking impact, excluding LTC 6  Total remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves   Change in fair value of market risk benefits (139) 123 Amortization of DAC (2)  Total benefits and expenses (134) 129 Pretax income (loss) (1) $ 133 $ (113) (1) Includes a $2 million net expense related to the market impact on IUL benefits for 2022, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking. The primary drivers of the year-over-year unlocking impact include the following items:  Interest rate assumptions resulted in a benefit in 2022.  Mortality assumption on variable annuities with living benefit guarantees resulted in a higher expense in 2022 compared to the prior year. Net Revenues Management and financial advice fees decreased $242 million, or 3%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting market depreciation, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, and a decrease in performance fees of $39 million, partially offset by revenue associated with the acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business and continued wrap account net inflows. Distribution fees increased $111 million, or 6%, for 2022 compared to the prior year due to $264 million of higher fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower average equity markets and decreased transactional activity. Net investment income decreased $209 million, or 12%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the following impacts:  Net realized investment losses of $87 million for 2022 compared to net realized investment gains of $636 million for the prior year period. Net realized losses for 2022 were primarily driven by the fixed maturity investment portfolio repositioning in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net realized gains for 2021 included net realized gains of $561 million on Available-for-Sale securities and a $58 million net gain related to commercial mortgage loans primarily due to the sale of securities and loans to the reinsurer as a result of the fixed deferred and payout annuity reinsurance transaction that closed in the third quarter 2021, as well as a $15 million gain on a strategic investment.  The favorable impact of the recent trend in rising interest rates on the investment portfolio yield, including the fourth quarter of 2022 impact of portfolio repositioning.  The favorable impact of growth in Ameriprise Bank and certificate businesses as a result of the market environment and our strategic decision to invest in the businesses.  The unfavorable impact of lower average invested assets due to the sale of investments as a result of the fixed deferred and payout annuity reinsurance transaction in the prior year.  The $22 million unfavorable market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on certain investments in the prior year. Premiums, policy and contract charges increased $1.2 billion for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting ceded premiums of $1.2 billion associated with the reinsurance transaction for life contingent payout annuity policies in the prior year. Other revenues increased $109 million, or 29%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from the reinsurance transactions. Banking and deposit interest expense increased $64 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average crediting rates on certificates and bank cash deposits and increased cash deposits at the bank. 51 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Expenses Distribution expenses decreased $93 million, or 2%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily lower average equity markets and decreased transactional activity. Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $65 million, or 11%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  An $23 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $13 million for 2022 compared to an unfavorable impact of $10 million for the prior year.  A $105 million increase in expense from other market impacts on IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $51 million for 2022 compared to a benefit of $54 million for the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in the IUL embedded derivative in the current year period, which reflected higher option costs due to a higher new money rate, compared to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior year period, which reflected lower option costs due to higher discount rates. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $398 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  A $1.2 billion decrease in expense associated with the reinsurance transaction for life contingent payout annuity policies in the prior year.  An $806 million decrease in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.0 billion change in the market impact on the SVA embedded derivative, partially offset by an unfavorable $224 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets, which resulted in a benefit for 2022 compared to an expense in the prior year. Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves increased $53 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in expense on LTC insurance as policy and claim terminations returned to more normalized levels compared to the prior year period which benefited from COVID-19 related impacts. Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased $424 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:  A $769 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This decrease was the result of an unfavorable $865 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves, partially offset by a favorable $96 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:  Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for 2022 compared to a benefit in the prior year.  Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for 2022 compared to an expense in the prior year.  Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for 2022 compared to the prior year.  Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a higher net expense for 2022 compared to the prior year. General and administrative expense increased $288 million, or 8%, 2022 the prior year primarily reflecting the operating expenses of the acquired BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business and higher integration related expenses, partially offset by disciplined expense management and reengineering, lower performance fee related compensation and a favorable foreign exchange impact. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 19.9% for 2022 compared to 18.3% for the prior year.

Average advisory wrap account assets increased $4.6 billion, or 1%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows, partially offset by market depreciation. 54 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Distribution fees decreased $4 million for 2022 compared to the prior year reflecting lower average equity markets and decreased transactional activity mostly offset by $264 million of higher fees on off-balance sheet brokerage cash due to an increase in average short-term interest rates. Net investment income increased $491 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average invested assets due to increased bank deposits and higher investment yields on the investment portfolio supporting the bank and certificate products. Banking and deposit interest expense increased $64 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher average crediting rates on bank cash deposits and certificates and increased cash deposits at the bank. Expenses Distribution expenses decreased $123 million, or 3%, for 2022 compared to the prior year reflecting market depreciation and decreased transactional activity. General and administrative expense increased $114 million, or 8%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher volume related expenses and investments in business growth as well as lower staffing levels and limited travel and entertainment expenses in the prior year.

Variable annuity account balances decreased 19% to $74.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year due to market depreciation and net outflows of $2.1 billion. Variable annuity sales decreased 33% to $4.0 billion for 2022 compared to the prior year reflecting a decrease in sales of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. Account values with living benefit riders declined to 57% as of December 31, 2022 compared to 61% a year ago reflecting our actions to optimize our business mix. This trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of business away from products with living benefit guarantees over time. We continue to optimize our risk profile and shift our business mix to lower risk offerings. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we made the decision to discontinue new sales of our variable annuities with living benefit guarantees at the end of 2021, and have stopped issuing new contracts as of mid-2022. In addition, we discontinued new sales of our universal life insurance with secondary guarantees and our single-pay fixed universal life with a long term care rider products at the end of 2021. Net Revenues Management and financial advice fees decreased $144 million, or 15%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower average equity markets and variable annuity net outflows. Distribution fees decreased $67 million, or 14%, for 2022 compared to the prior year reflecting lower average equity markets and lower sales. Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, increased $89 million, or 19%, for 2022 compared to the prior year reflecting higher fixed maturity investment yields and increased volume of invested assets partially driven by our portfolio repositioning in the fourth quarter. Expenses Distribution expenses decreased $96 million, or 18%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower variable annuity and insurance sales and market depreciation. 58 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on structured variable annuities indexed account embedded derivative (net of hedges) and mean reversion related impacts, increased $42 million, or 10%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the impacts of equity market depreciation and higher interest rates, as well as increased volume in SVAs. Change in fair value of market risk benefits, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges), decreased $308 million, or 45%, for 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, equity market depreciation and variable annuity net outflows. The unlocking impact for 2022 was a benefit of $139 million primarily reflecting the impact of interest rate assumptions, partially offset by lower surrender assumptions and updated mortality assumptions for variable annuities with living benefits compared to an expense of $123 million for the prior year which was driven by lower surrender assumptions. Corporate & Other The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis: Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 (in millions) Revenues Distribution fees $  $ 1 $ (1) NM Net investment income 155 242 (87) (36) Premiums, policy and contract charges 99 100 (1) (1) Other revenues 230 146 84 58 Total revenues 484 489 (5) (1) Banking and deposit interest expense 5 2 3 NM Total net revenues 479 487 (8) (2) Expenses Distribution expenses (10) (9) (1) 11 Interest credited to fixed accounts 242 250 (8) (3) Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 247 245 2 1 Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves  (46) 46 NM Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 10 8 2 25 Interest and debt expense 70 63 7 11 General and administrative expense 226 265 (39) (15) Total expenses 785 776 9 1 Operating loss $ (306) $ (289) $ (17) (6) % NM Not Meaningful - variance equal to or greater than 100%.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased $17 million, or 6%, for 2022 compared to the prior year. Our LTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $10 million for 2022 compared to pretax adjusted operating earnings of $29 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the favorable impacts in 2021 from COVID-19 effects on policyholder expenses. FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $22 million for 2022 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $20 million for the prior year. Fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 6% to $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period as surrender trends continued. During the third quarter of 2021, we closed on a transaction to reinsure RiverSource Lifes fixed deferred and payout annuity policies. Net Revenues Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs, decreased $87 million, or 36%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting lower average invested assets due to the sale of investments to the reinsurer as a result of the fixed deferred and payout annuity reinsurance transaction and a $15 million gain on a strategic investment in the prior year. 59 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Other revenues increased $84 million, or 58%, for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from reinsurance transactions. Expenses Remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves increased $46 million for 2022 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in expense on LTC insurance as policy and claim terminations returned to more normalized levels compared to the prior year which benefited from COVID-19 related impacts. General and administrative expense, which excludes integration and restructuring charges and expenses attributable to CIEs, decreased $39 million, or 15%, to 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a larger unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses in the prior year due to share price appreciation. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements. Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of December 31, 2023. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately $795 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on December 31, 2023 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had Available Capital for Capital Adequacy of $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. Available Capital for Capital Adequacy best reflects the available capital resources of our operations. We maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $7.5 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the parent company had $544 million and $389 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage back securities. Additional sources of liquidity include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $727 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Managements estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of December 31, 2023 was $1.8 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility. Under the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remain in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2023. In addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $8.6 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and 60 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we estimated $12.3 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations. Short-term contractual obligations for the year 2024 include investment certificate maturities of $12.3 billion and estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $2.2 billion in addition to operating liquidity needs and maturing long-term debt in October 2024 of $550 million. We also hold banking and brokerage deposits of $23.9 billion that are payable on demand. Long-term contractual obligations for years after 2024 include estimated insurance and annuity benefits of $55.2 billion. On March 9, 2023, we issued $750 million of 5.15% unsecured senior notes due May 15, 2033. We repaid $750 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity on October 16, 2023. On November 9, 2023, we issued $600 million of 5.7% unsecured senior notes due December 15, 2028. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings, access to debt markets and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements. On August 16, 2022, federal legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) and the share repurchase excise tax. Both the CAMT and share repurchase tax were effective beginning in 2023. We are an applicable corporation required to compute the CAMT; however, based on current estimates we do not expect to be liable for the CAMT in 2023 and therefore a liability has not been recorded. We are a covered corporation subject to the 1% excise tax on the net shares repurchased. We have recorded in shareholders equity an estimate of the excise tax liability based on our interpretation of the current guidance. As the Internal Revenue Service issues additional guidance related to the IRA, we will continue to evaluate any impact to our consolidated financial statements. In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. Various jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation that became effective beginning January 1, 2024. We continue to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Dividends from Subsidiaries Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (ACC), Ameriprise Bank, AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (AFS) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc.

(CMIS), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (CMIA), TAM UK International Holdings Ltd., which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. For example, RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advanced notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MN DOC), RiverSource Lifes primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of the previous years statutory net gain from operations or 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as extraordinary dividends. Extraordinary dividends also require advanced notice to MN DOC, and are subject to potential disapproval. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an alternative net capital requirement which AEIS and AFS (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250 thousand or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (CEIT) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements 61 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and Ameriprise Banks internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, we have elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital. ACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets. Required capital for Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the FCA, under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for investment firms. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) RiverSource Life (1) $ 3,093 $ 3,103 $ 512 $ 571 RiverSource Life of NY (1) 244 320 40 40 ACC (3)(4) 765 534 717 496 TAM UK International Holdings Ltd.

In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the Building Block Approach for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. The rule is effective January 1, 2024, with reporting to the FRB beginning in 2025. In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 62 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

(7) Total $ 2,778 $ 1,976 $ 2,776 In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (GLIC) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs, as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $569 million and $553 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On January 24, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 27, 2024 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on February 9, 2024. In January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $3.0 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through March 31, 2024, which was exhausted in the fourth quarter of 2023. In July 2023, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through September 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2023, we had $3.1 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $330.94 per share. Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial. 63 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $278 million to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $4.4 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting higher investment income on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by higher income taxes paid and higher cash outflows in brokerage deposits. The higher investment income is driven by higher yields and the growth in Ameriprise Bank customer deposits and certificate business growth. Investing Activities Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio and in recent quarters is significantly affected by the net flows of our face amount certificates and bank deposit activity. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.3 billion to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $13.6 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a $2.3 billion decrease in purchases of Available-for-Sale securities and a $1.6 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $4.0 billion to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $8.4 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a $3.7 billion decrease in the change in banking deposits, net.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products, fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, fixed annuity and insurance contracts, the value of market risk benefits and other liabilities associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge related benefits. Market risk benefits continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the benefits. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life (IUL) insurance and the associated hedging instruments, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices. 65 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is $(319) million as of December 31, 2023 and $(283) million as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Net impacts shown in the above tables from market risk benefits result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation. Actual results could and likely will differ materially from those illustrated above as fair values have a number of estimates and assumptions. For example, the illustration above includes assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. Asset-Based Management and Distribution Fees We earn asset-based management fees and distribution fees on our assets under management. As of December 31, 2023, the value of our assets under management was $1.1 trillion. These sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices. We currently only hedge certain equity price risk for this exposure, primarily using futures and swaps. We currently do not hedge any of the interest rate risk for this exposure. Market Risk Benefits The total contract value of all variable annuities as of December 31, 2023 was $80.8 billion. See Note 13 for details of the reserves associated with market risk benefits. The changes in fair value of variable annuity market risk benefits are recorded through earnings, with the exception of the portion of the change in fair value due to a change in our nonperformance risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Fair value is calculated based on projected, discounted cash flows over the life of the contract, including projected, discounted benefits and fees. Equity Price Risk The variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets. For this reason, when equity prices decline, the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts. In that case, reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings. The core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of these benefits are longer dated put and call options; these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments. 67 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Interest Rate Risk Increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the liabilities and may result in market risk benefits in an asset position. The interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of interest rate swaps, futures and swaptions. We have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities, thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms. If interest rates were to increase, we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty, and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease, resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income. Structured Variable Annuities Structured variable annuities offer the contractholder the ability to allocate account value to either an account that earns fixed interest (fixed account) or an account that is impacted by the performance of various equity indices (indexed account) subject to a cap, floor or buffer. Our earnings are based upon the spread between investment income earned and the credits made to the fixed account and benefits reflected in an indexed account of the structured variable annuities. As of December 31, 2023, we had $10.7 billion in liabilities related to structured variable annuities. Equity Price Risk The equity-linked return to contractholders creates equity price risk as the amount paid to contractholders depends on changes in equity prices. The equity price risk for structured variable annuities is evaluated together with the variable annuity riders as part of a hedge program using the derivative instruments consistent with our hedging on variable annuity riders. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of the embedded derivative associated with structured variable annuities is based on a discounted cash flow approach. Changes in interest rates impact the discounting of the embedded derivative liability. The spread between the investment income earned and amounts transferred to contractholders is also affected by changes in interest rates. These interest rate risks associated with structured variable annuities are not currently hedged. Fixed Annuities, Fixed Insurance and Fixed Portion of Variable Annuities and Variable Insurance Contracts Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. While interest rates under the current environment have relieved some pressure from the liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (GMIRs), there are still some GMIRs above current levels. Hence, liability credited rates will move more slowly under a modest rise in interest rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. Of the $37.5 billion in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims as of December 31, 2023, $16.9 billion is related to liabilities created by these products. We do not hedge this exposure. As a result of the current market environment, reinvestment yields are becoming more aligned with the current portfolio yield. We would expect the recent decline in our portfolio income yields to slow and begin to stabilize in future periods under the current environment. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2025 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $5.6 billion and 4.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which can be subject to prepayment risk under a low interest rate environment, totaled $21.1 billion and had a weighted average yield of 4.4% as of December 31, 2023. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at managements discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 5.8%. The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates near the current portfolio yield will have a limited impact to future operating results. In this volatile rate environment, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may update the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 68 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. See Note 11 for more information on the account values of fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of GMIRs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Banking Deposits and Brokerage Client Cash Balances We pay interest on banking deposits and certain brokerage client cash balances and have the ability to reset these rates from time to time based on prevailing economic and business conditions. We earn revenue to fund the interest paid from interest-earning assets or fees from off-balance sheet deposits at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured institutions, which are indexed to short-term interest rates. In general, the change in interest paid lags the change in revenues earned. Certificate Products Fixed Rate Certificates We have interest rate risk from our investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from $1 thousand to $2 million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from 3 to 36 months. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed income securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income. Client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments. This exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected interest rate environment. Of the $37.3 billion in customer deposits as of December 31, 2023, $13.3 billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products. Indexed Universal Life IUL insurance is similar to UL in many regards, although the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to an indexed account is linked to the performance of the specified index for the indexed account (subject to stated account parameters, which include a cap and floor, or a spread and floor). The policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account. As of December 31, 2023, we had $2.7 billion in liabilities related to the indexed accounts of IUL. Equity Price Risk The equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices. Most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities. To hedge the equity exposure, a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts. Interest Rate Risk As mentioned above, most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads and options. There are two risks relating to interest rates. First, we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads. Second, in the event the policy is surrendered we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability (if interest rates have risen). This risk is not currently hedged. Foreign Currency Risk We have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries. We are primarily exposed to changes in British Pounds related to our net investment in Threadneedle, which was approximately 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. We also have exposure related to operations in foreign countries to Euros, Indian Rupees and other currencies. We monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent. As of December 31, 2023, the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material. Interest Rate Risk on External Debt The stated interest rates on our $3.4 billion of senior unsecured notes are fixed. Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio, including our loan portfolio, and through our derivative and reinsurance activities. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligors continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract. We consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with pre-established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk. These guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. 69 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. We manage the risk of credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards, prudently limiting exposures to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments, and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and underlying investment type. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing. We manage our credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. Generally, our current credit exposure on over-the-counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterpartys net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received. This exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level. The counterparty risk for centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives is transferred to a central clearing party through contract novation. The central clearing party requires both daily settlement of mark-to-market and initial margin. Because the central clearing party monitors open positions and adjusts collateral requirements daily, we have minimal credit exposure from such derivative instruments. Exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges that require contract standardization and initial margin to transact through the exchange. Because exchange-traded futures are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis, we have minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments. Other exchange-traded derivatives would be exposed to nonperformance by counterparties for amounts in excess of initial margin requirements only if the exchange is unable to fulfill the contract. We manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties. In addition, we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties. As of December 31, 2023, our largest reinsurance credit risks are related to coinsurance treaties with Global Atlantic Financial Groups subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and with life insurance subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance. 70 Index Ameriprise Fina

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) 169 71 Index Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for long-duration insurance contracts in 2023. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 72 Index Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of market risk benefits As described in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on variable annuity products that provide minimum guarantees to contractholders. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value, at the individual contract level, using a non-option-based valuation approach or an option-based valuation approach, dependent upon the fee structure of the contract. The significant assumptions used by management to develop the fair value measurements of market risk benefits include utilization of guaranteed withdrawals, surrender rate, market volatility, nonperformance risk and mortality rate. As of December 31, 2023, the market risk benefits asset was $1,427 million and the market risk benefits liability was $1,762 million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of market risk benefits is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the market risk benefits, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to managements significant assumptions related to utilization of guaranteed withdrawals, surrender rate, market volatility, nonperformance risk and mortality rate (collectively, the significant market risk benefit assumptions), and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to market risk benefits, including controls over the reasonableness of the significant market risk benefit assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the market risk benefits, (ii) testing, on a sample basis, the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the significant market risk benefit assumptions based on industry knowledge and data as well as historical Company data and experience, and the continued appropriateness of unchanged assumptions. Adoption of the new accounting standard for long-duration insurance contracts As described above and in Notes 2, 3, 11 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the new accounting standard relating to targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts (LDTI). When management adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2023 with a transition date of January 1, 2021, opening equity was adjusted for the adoption impacts to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income and prior periods presented (i.e. 2021 and 2022) were restated. The new standard changes elements of the measurement models and disclosure requirements for an insurers long-duration insurance contract benefits and acquisition costs by expanding the use of fair value accounting to certain contract benefits and requiring at least annual updates to assumptions used to measure liabilities for future policy benefits. As of the January 1, 2021 transition date, the adoption impact was a reduction in total equity of $1.9 billion. The adjustments to retrospectively recast prior period amounts resulted in an increase of $190 million and a decrease of $1.1 billion to total equity as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and an increase to net income of $590 million and $657 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The adjustments as of January 1, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include the remeasurement of the liability for future policy benefits at a current single A discount rate and the establishment of assets and liabilities for the market risk benefits. The discount rate represents an upper-medium-grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield (i.e., an A rating) that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. Discount rates are locked in annually, at the end of each year for all products, except life contingent payout annuities, and calculated as the monthly average discount rate curves for the year. For life contingent payout annuities, the discount rates are locked in quarterly, at the end of each quarter based on the average of the three months for the quarter. The significant assumptions used by management to develop the fair value measurements of market risk benefits include utilization of guaranteed withdrawals, surrender rate, market volatility, nonperformance risk and mortality rate (collectively, the significant market risk benefit assumptions). As of December 31, 2022, the market risk benefits assets amounted to $1.0 billion, and the market risk benefits liabilities amounted to $2.1 billion. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the adoption of the new accounting standard for LDTI is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when adopting the LDTI standard and determining the transition date adjustments and the transition period adjustments, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) managements discount rate methodology and development of the discount rate curve used in determining the liability for future policy benefits, and (b) managements significant market risk benefit assumptions used in determining the fair value of market risk benefits in connection with adopting the new standard, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. 73 Index Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to managements adoption of the new accounting standard for LDTI, including controls over determining the transition date adjustments and transition period adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating managements process for adopting the LDTI standard and for determining the transition date and transition period adjustments, (ii) testing the relevance and reliability of the external data used by management to develop the discount rate curve, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management to develop and update the significant market risk benefit assumptions, and (iv) the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating, based on the consideration the Companys historical and actual experience, industry trends, and market conditions, as applicable, the (a) appropriateness of the discount rate methodology and the reasonableness of the discount rate curve, and (b) the reasonableness of the significant market risk benefit assumptions used to determine the fair value of market risk benefits in connection with adopting the new standard. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 22, 2024 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2010. 74 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform with the current presentation. On July 13, 2023, the Company announced that it withdrew its application to convert Ameriprise Bank, FSB (Ameriprise Bank) to a state-chartered industrial bank and its application to establish a new limited purpose national trust bank. Ameriprise Bank will continue to operate as it does today, regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company evaluated events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date for potential recognition or disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued. No subsequent events or transactions requiring recognition or disclosure were identified. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU), Financial Services  Insurance  Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (ASU 2018-12), effective January 1, 2023 with a transition date of January 1, 2021. The significant accounting policies for market risk benefits (MRB); deferred acquisition costs (DAC); deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC); reinsurance; policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims; and unearned revenue liability were added or updated as a result of adopting the new accounting standard. See Note 3 for additional information related to the transition approach and adoption impact. Principles of Consolidation A VIE is an entity that either has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest (including substantive voting rights, the obligation to absorb the entitys losses, or the rights to receive the entitys returns) or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Voting interest entities (VOEs) are those entities that do not qualify as a VIE. The Company consolidates VOEs in which it holds a greater than 50% voting interest. The Company generally accounts for entities using the equity method when it holds a greater than 20% but less than 50% voting interest or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity. All other investments that are not reported at fair value as trading or Available-for-Sale securities are accounted for using the measurement alternative method when the Company owns less than a 20% voting interest and does not exercise significant influence. Under the measurement alternative, the investment is recorded at the cost basis, less impairments, if any, plus or minus observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. A VIE is consolidated by the reporting entity that determines it has both:  the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance; and  the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits to the VIE. All VIEs are assessed for consolidation under this framework. When evaluating entities for consolidation, the Company considers its contractual rights in determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. In determining whether the Company has this power, it considers whether it is acting in a role that enables it to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of an entity or if it is acting in an agent role. In determining whether the Company has the obligation to absorb potential significant losses of the VIE or the right to receive potential significant benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers an analysis of its rights to receive benefits such as investment returns and its obligation to absorb losses associated with any investment in the VIE in conjunction with other qualitative factors. Management and incentive fees that are at market and commensurate with the level of services provided, and where the Company does not hold other interests in the VIE that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the VIEs expected losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the VIEs expected residual returns, are not considered a variable interest and are excluded from the analysis. The consolidation guidance has a scope exception for reporting entities with interests in registered money market funds which do not have an explicit support agreement. 81 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses are translated at average daily exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustment, along with any related hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The determination of the functional currency is based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in General and administrative expenses. Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In part, they are based upon assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant are those that relate to investment securities valuation and the recognition of credit losses or impairments, valuation of derivative instruments, litigation reserves, future policy benefits, market risk benefits, and income taxes and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management and actual results could differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less. Investments Available-for-Sale Securities Available-for-Sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) recorded in AOCI, net of impacts to benefit reserves, reinsurance recoverables and income taxes. Available-for-Sale securities are recorded within Investments. Gains and losses are recognized on a trade date basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon disposition of the securities. Available-for-Sale securities are impaired when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost. When an Available-for-Sale security is impaired, the Company first assesses whether or not: (i) it has the intent to sell the security (i.e., made a decision to sell) or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions exist, the Company recognizes an impairment by reducing the book value of the security for the difference between the investments amortized cost and its fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings. Subsequent increases in the fair value of Available-for-Sale securities that occur in periods after a write-down has occurred are recorded as unrealized gains in other comprehensive income (OCI), while subsequent decreases in fair value would continue to be recorded as reductions of book value with a charge to earnings. For securities that do not meet the above criteria, the Company determines whether the decrease in fair value is due to a credit loss or due to other factors. The amount of impairment due to credit-related factors, if any, is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a related charge to Net investment income. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the securitys amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI. Factors the Company considers in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are due to credit-related factors include: (i) the extent to which the market value is below amortized cost; (ii) fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer; and (iii) market events that could impact credit ratings, economic and business climate, litigation and government actions, and similar external business factors. If through subsequent evaluation there is a sustained increase in cash flows expected, both the allowance and related charge to earnings may be reversed to reflect the increase in expected principal and interest payments. In order to determine the amount of the credit loss component for corporate debt securities, a best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the securitys effective interest rate is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. The significant inputs to cash flow projections consider potential debt restructuring terms, projected cash flows available to pay creditors and the Companys position in the debtors overall capital structure. When assessing potential credit-related impairments for structured investments (e.g., residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and other structured investments), the Company also considers credit-related factors such as overall deal structure and its position within the structure, quality of underlying collateral, delinquencies and defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments and cumulative loss projections. Management has elected to exclude accrued interest in its measurement of the allowance for credit losses for Available-for-Sale securities. Accrued interest on Available-for-Sale securities is recorded as earned in Receivables. Available-for-Sale securities are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the accrued balance becomes 90 days past due or earlier based on managements evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each security under review. All previously accrued interest is reversed through Net investment income. 82 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Financing Receivables Commercial Loans Commercial loans include commercial mortgage loans, syndicated loans, and advisor loans and are recorded at amortized cost less the allowance for credit losses. Commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans are recorded within Investments and advisor loans are recorded within Receivables. Commercial mortgage loans are loans on commercial properties that are originated by the Company. Syndicated loans represent the Companys investment in loan syndications originated by unrelated third parties. The Company offers loans to financial advisors primarily for recruiting, transitional cost assistance, retention purposes, practice operations, and growth strategies. These advisor loans are generally repaid over a five- to ten-year period. If the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with the Company, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due. Interest income is accrued as earned on the unpaid principal balances of the loans. Interest income recognized on commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans is recorded in Net investment income. Interest income recognized on advisor loans is recorded in Other revenues. Consumer Loans Consumer loans consist of credit card receivables, residential mortgage loans, policy loans, brokerage margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit and are recorded at amortized cost less the allowance for loan losses. Credit card receivables, residential mortgage loans and policy loans are recorded within Investments. Brokerage margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit are recorded within Receivables. Credit card receivables are related to Ameriprise-branded credit cards issued to the Companys customers by a third party. When originated, policy loan balances do not exceed the cash surrender value of the underlying products. The Companys broker dealer subsidiaries enter into lending arrangements with clients through the normal course of business, which are primarily based on customer margin levels. Ameriprise Bank enters into revolving lines of credit with customers of the Companys broker dealer subsidiaries, where certain of the customers assets held in brokerage accounts serve as collateral. Interest income is accrued as earned on the unpaid principal balances of the loans. Interest income recognized on consumer loans is recorded in Net investment income. Deposit Receivables For each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability related to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits made and any related embedded derivatives are included in Receivables. As amounts are received, consistent with the underlying contracts, deposit receivables are adjusted. Deposit receivables are accreted using the interest method and the accretion is reported in Other revenues. See Note 7 for additional information on financing receivables. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected over the assets expected life, considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Estimates of expected credit losses consider both historical charge-off and recovery experience as well as current economic conditions and managements expectation of future charge-off and recovery levels. Expected losses related to risks other than credit risk are excluded from the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured and recorded upon initial recognition of the loan, regardless of whether it is originated or purchased. The methods and information used to develop the allowance for credit losses for each class of financing receivable are discussed below. Commercial Loans The allowance for credit losses for commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans utilizes a probability of default and loss severity approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses. Actual historical default and loss severity data for each type of commercial loan is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to develop the probability of default and loss severity assumptions that are applied to the amortized cost basis of the loans over the expected life of each portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans is recorded through provisions charged to Net investment income and is reduced/increased by net charge-offs/recoveries. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on the overall loan portfolio composition, recent and historical loss experience, and other pertinent factors, including when applicable, internal risk ratings, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and occupancy rates, along with reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic and market conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates, which may be susceptible to significant change. While the Company may attribute portions of the allowance to specific loan pools as part of the allowance estimation process, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses expected over the life of the loan portfolio. 83 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) When determining the allowance for credit losses for advisor loans, the Company considers its actual historical collection experience and advisor termination experience as well as other factors including amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, length of time since termination, and the former financial advisors overall financial position. Management may identify certain pools of advisors at higher risk of termination based on production metrics or other factors. Management uses its best estimate of future termination and collection rates to estimate expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans. The allowance for credit losses on advisor loans is recorded through provisions charged to Distribution expenses and is reduced/increased by net charge-offs/recoveries. Consumer Loans The allowance for loan losses for credit card receivables and residential mortgage loans are based on models that project the Companys receivable exposure over the expected life of the loans using cohorts based on the age of the receivable, geographic location, and credit scores. The models utilize industry data to derive probability of default and loss given default assumptions, adjusted for current and future economic conditions. Management evaluates actual historical charge-off experience and monitors risk factors including FICO scores and past-due status within the credit card portfolio, and FICO scores, LTV ratios, and past-due status within the residential mortgage loan portfolio, to ensure the allowance for loan losses based on industry data appropriately reserves for risks specific to the Companys portfolios. The allowance for credit losses for credit card receivables and residential mortgage loans are recorded through provisions charged to Net investment income and are reduced/increased by net charge-offs/recoveries. The Company monitors the market value of collateral supporting the margin loans and pledged asset lines of credit and requests additional collateral when necessary in order to mitigate the risk of loss. Due to these ongoing monitoring procedures, the allowance for credit losses is only measured for the margin loan balances and pledged asset line of credit balances that are uncollateralized at the balance sheet date. Policy loans do not exceed the cash surrender value at origination. As there is minimal risk of loss related to policy loans, there is no allowance for credit losses. Deposit Receivables The allowance for credit losses is calculated on an individual reinsurer basis. Deposit receivables are collateralized by underlying trust arrangements. Management evaluates the terms of the reinsurance and trust agreements, the nature of the underlying assets, and the potential for changes in the collateral value when considering the need for an allowance for credit losses. Nonaccrual Loans Commercial mortgage loans and syndicated loans are placed on nonaccrual status when either the collection of interest or principal has become 90 days past due or is otherwise considered doubtful of collection. Advisor loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon the advisors termination. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest payments received on loans on nonaccrual status are generally applied to principal unless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible. Management has elected to exclude accrued interest in its measurement of the allowance for credit losses for commercial mortgage loans, syndicated loans, and consumer loans. Loan Modifications A loan is modified when the Company makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms such as principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, and/or term extensions in an attempt to make the loan more affordable to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Generally, performance prior to the modification or significant events that coincide with the modification are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms which may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of the modification or after a performance period. If the borrowers ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status. Charge-off and Foreclosure Commercial Loans Charge-offs are recorded when the Company concludes that all or a portion of the commercial mortgage loan or syndicated loan is uncollectible. Factors used by the Company to determine whether all amounts due on commercial mortgage loans will be collected, include but are not limited to, the financial condition of the borrower, performance of the underlying properties, collateral and/or guarantees on the loan, and the borrowers estimated future ability to pay based on property type and geographic location. Factors used by the Company to determine whether all amounts due on syndicated loans will be collected, include but are not limited to the borrowers financial condition, industry outlook, and internal risk ratings based on rating agency data and internal analyst expectations. If it is determined that foreclosure on a commercial mortgage loan is probable and the fair value is less than the current loan balance, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and fair value less estimated costs to sell, if applicable. Upon foreclosure, the commercial mortgage loan and related allowance are reversed, and the foreclosed property is recorded as real estate owned within Other assets. 84 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Concerns regarding the recoverability of loans to advisors primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with the Company. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balance of the loan is written-off and the related allowance is reduced. Consumer Loans Credit card receivables are not placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due; however, they are fully charged off upon reaching 180 days past due. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities Separate account assets represent funds held for the benefit of, and Separate account liabilities represent the obligation to, the variable annuity contractholders and variable life insurance policyholders who have a contractual right to receive the benefits of their contract or policy and bear the related investment risk. Gains and losses on separate account assets accrue directly to the contractholder or policyholder and are not reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in separate account assets and liabilities is the fair value of the pooled pension funds that are offered by Threadneedle. Threadneedle provides a range of unitized pooled pension funds, which invest in property, stocks, bonds and cash. The investments are selected by the clients and are based on the level of risk they are willing to assume. All investment performance, net of fees, is passed through to the investors. Separate account assets are recorded at fair value and Separate account liabilities are equal to the assets recognized. Restricted and Segregated Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Amounts segregated under federal and other regulations are held in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of the Companys brokerage customers. Cash and cash equivalents included in Restricted and segregated cash, cash equivalents and investments are presented as part of cash balances in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software Land, buildings, equipment and internally developed software are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization and are reflected within Other assets. The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization over periods ranging from three to 39 years. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, land, buildings, equipment and software were $ 681 million and $ 630 million, respectively, net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.9 billion, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 151 million, $ 142 million and $ 144 million, respectively. Leases The Company has operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception or modification. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and corresponding lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined at lease commencement date using a secured rate for a similar term as the period of the lease. Certain lease incentives such as free rent periods are recorded as a reduction of the ROU asset. Lease costs for operating ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases include one or more options to renew with terms that can extend the lease from one year to 10 years. The exercise of any lease renewal option is at the sole discretion of the Company. Renewal options are included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities when they either provide an economic incentive to renew or when the costs related to the termination of a lease outweigh the benefits of signing a new lease. Operating and finance ROU assets are reflected in Other assets. Operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities are reflected in Other liabilities and Long-term debt, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the amount of an acquired companys acquisition cost in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on the measurement date of July 1 and whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit. Impairment is the amount carrying value exceeds fair value and is evaluated at the reporting unit level. The Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether impairment is likely to have occurred. If impairment were to occur, the Company would use the discounted cash flow method, a variation of the income approach. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless they are deemed to have indefinite useful lives. The Company evaluates the definite lived intangible assets remaining useful lives annually and tests for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. For definite lived intangible assets, impairment to fair value is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable. Indefinite lived intangibles are also tested for impairment annually or whenever circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. 85 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Goodwill and other intangible assets are reflected in Other assets. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Freestanding derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are reflected in Other assets or Other liabilities. The Companys policy is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any. The Company primarily uses derivatives as economic hedges that are not designated as accounting hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company occasionally designates derivatives as (i) hedges of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments (fair value hedges), (ii) hedges of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedges), or (iii) hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges in foreign operations). Derivative instruments that are entered into for hedging purposes are designated as such at the time the Company enters into the contract. For all derivative instruments that are designated for hedging activities, the Company documents all of the hedging relationships between the hedge instruments and the hedged items at the inception of the relationships. Management also documents its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transactions. The Company assesses, at inception and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the Company will discontinue the application of hedge accounting. For derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the nature and use of the instrument. Changes in fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with the corresponding change in the hedged asset or liability. For derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives, as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments, are recognized on a net basis in current period earnings. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in fair value from the designated hedged risk. If a fair value hedge designation is removed or the hedge is terminated prior to maturity, previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are recognized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with the hedged instrument or transaction impact. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in current period earnings as a component of Net investment income. If a hedge designation is removed or a hedge is terminated prior to maturity, the amount previously recorded in AOCI is reclassified to earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in AOCI are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivative instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in foreign operations, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Any ineffective portion of the net investment hedges in foreign operations is recognized in Net investment income during the period of change. The equity component of indexed annuity, structured variable annuity, indexed universal life (IUL) and stock market certificate (SMC) obligations are considered embedded derivatives. Additionally, certain annuities contain guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) provisions accounted for as market risk benefits. See Note 16 for information regarding the Companys fair value measurement of derivative instruments and Note 18 for the impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Market Risk Benefits Market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits include certain contract features on variable annuity products that provide minimum guarantees to contractholders. Guarantees accounted for as market risk benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB), GMWB and GMAB. If a contract contains multiple market risk benefits, those market risk benefits are bundled together as a single compound market risk benefit. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value, at the individual contract level, using a non-option-based valuation approach or an option-based valuation approach, dependent upon the fee structure of the contract. Changes in fair value are recognized in net income each period with the exception of the portion of the change in fair value due to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, which is recognized in OCI. 86 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Deferred Acquisition Costs The Company incurs costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance and annuity businesses. The portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract are deferred. Significant costs capitalized include sales based compensation related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and annuity contracts, medical inspection costs for successful sales, and a portion of employee compensation and benefit costs based upon the amount of time spent on successful sales. Sales based compensation paid to advisors and employees and third-party distributors is capitalized. Employee compensation and benefits costs which are capitalized relate primarily to sales efforts, underwriting and processing. All other costs which are not incremental direct costs of acquiring an insurance policy or annuity contract are expensed as incurred. The DAC associated with insurance policies or annuity contracts that are significantly modified or internally replaced with another contract are accounted for as write-offs. These transactions are anticipated in establishing amortization periods and other valuation assumptions. The Company monitors other DAC amortization assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, and variable annuity benefit utilization each quarter and, when assessed independently, each could impact the Companys DAC balances. Unamortized DAC is reduced for actual experience in excess of expected experience. The analysis of DAC balances and the corresponding amortization considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously. Unless the Companys management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these DAC amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year. DAC is amortized on a constant-level basis for the grouped contracts over the expected contract term to approximate straight-line amortization. Contracts are grouped by contract type and issue year into cohorts consistent with the grouping used in estimating the associated liability for future policy benefits. DAC related to all long-duration product types (except for life contingent payout annuities) is grouped on a calendar-year annual basis for each legal entity. Further disaggregation is reported for any contracts that include an additional liability for death or other insurance benefit. DAC related to life contingent payout annuities is grouped on a calendar-year annual basis for each legal entity for policies issued prior to 2021 and on a quarterly basis for each legal entity thereafter. DAC related to annuity products (including variable deferred annuities, structured variable annuities, fixed deferred annuities, and life contingent payout annuities) is amortized based on initial premium. DAC related to life insurance products (including universal life (UL) insurance, variable universal life (VUL) insurance, IUL insurance, term life insurance, and whole life insurance) is amortized based on original specified amount (i.e., face amount). DAC related to disability income (DI) insurance is amortized based on original monthly benefit. The accounting contract term for annuity products (except for life contingent payout annuities) is the projected accumulation period. Life contingent payout annuities are amortized over the period which annuity payments are expected to be paid. The accounting contract term for life insurance products is the projected life of the contract. DI insurance is amortized over the projected life of the contract, including the claim paying period. Deferred Sales Inducement Costs Deferred sales inducements are contract features that are intended to attract new customers or to persuade existing customers to keep their current policy. Sales inducement costs consist of bonus interest credits and premium credits added to certain annuity contract and insurance policy values. These benefits are capitalized to the extent they are incremental to amounts that would be credited on similar contracts without the applicable feature. The amounts capitalized are amortized on a constant level basis using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. DSIC is recorded in Other assets and amortization of DSIC is recorded in Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Reinsurance The Company cedes insurance risk to other insurers under reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance premiums paid and benefits received are accounted for consistently with the basis used in accounting for the policies from which risk is reinsured and consistently with the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance premiums for traditional life, long term care (LTC) and DI insurance and life contingent payout annuities, net of the change in any prepaid reinsurance asset, are reported as a reduction of Premiums, policy and contract charges. Reinsurance recoveries are reported as components of Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. UL and VUL reinsurance premiums are reported as a reduction of Premiums, policy and contract charges. In addition, for UL and VUL insurance policies, the net cost of reinsurance ceded, which represents the discounted amount of the expected cash flows between the reinsurer and the Company, is classified as an asset and amortized based on estimated gross profits over the period the reinsured policies are in force. Changes in the net cost of reinsurance are reflected as a component of Premiums, policy and contract charges. Insurance liabilities are reported before the effects of reinsurance. Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims recoverable under reinsurance contracts are recorded within Receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses. The Company 87 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance contracts and on a periodic basis during the contract term. The allowance for credit losses related to reinsurance recoverable is based on applying observable industry data including insurer ratings, default and loss severity data to the Companys reinsurance recoverable balances. Management evaluates the results of the calculation and considers differences between the industry data and the Companys data. Such differences include that the Company has no actual history of significant losses and that industry data may contain non-life insurers. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates, which may be susceptible to significant change given the long-term nature of these receivables. In addition, the Company has a reinsurance protection agreement that provides credit protections for its reinsured long term care business. The allowance for credit losses on reinsurance recoverable is recorded through provisions charged to Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. The Company also assumes life insurance and fixed annuity risk from other insurers in limited circumstances. Reinsurance premiums received and benefits paid are accounted for consistently with the basis used in accounting for the policies from which risk is reinsured and consistently with the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Liabilities for assumed business are recorded within Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims. See Note 8 for additional information on reinsurance. Policyholder Account Balances, Future Policy Benefits and Claims The Company establishes reserves to cover the benefits associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable and structured variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life, whole life, DI and LTC insurance. Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products The liabilities for non-traditional long-duration products include fixed account values on variable and fixed annuities and UL and VUL policies, non-life contingent payout annuities, liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities (including structured variable annuities), and embedded derivatives for structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL products. Liabilities for fixed account values on variable annuities, structured variable annuities, fixed deferred annuities, and UL and VUL policies are equal to accumulation values, which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges. The liability for non-life contingent payout annuities is recognized as the present value of future payments using the effective yield at inception of the contract. A portion of the Companys UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined at the reporting date by estimating the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). See Note 11 for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees. Liabilities for fixed deferred indexed annuity, structured variable annuity and IUL products are equal to the accumulation of host contract values, guaranteed benefits, and the fair value of embedded derivatives. See Note 13 for information regarding variable annuity guarantees. Embedded Derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives related to structured variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL fluctuate based on equity markets and interest rates and the estimate of the Companys nonperformance risk and is recorded in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims. See Note 16 for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. Traditional Long-Duration Products The liabilities for traditional long-duration products include cash flows related to unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, DI, LTC, and life contingent payout annuity policies as claims are incurred in the future. The claim liability (also referred to as disabled life reserve) is presented together as one liability for future policy benefits. A liability for future policy benefits, which is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders, is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. Expected insurance benefits are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to premium revenue recognized (referred to as the net premium approach). The net premium ratio reflects cash flows from contract inception to contract termination (i.e., through the claim paying period) and cannot exceed 100%. Assumptions utilized in the net premium approach, including mortality, morbidity, and terminations, are reviewed as part of experience studies at least annually or more frequently if suggested by evidence. Expense assumptions and actual expenses are updated within the net premium calculation consistent with other policyholder assumptions. 88 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The updated cash flows used in the calculation are discounted using a forward rate curve. The discount rate represents an upper-medium-grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield (i.e., an A rating) that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. Discount rates are locked in annually, at the end of each year for all products, except life contingent payout annuities, and calculated as the monthly average discount rate curves for the year. For life contingent payout annuities, the discount rates are locked in quarterly at the end of each quarter based on the average of the three months for the quarter. The liability for future policy benefits will be updated for actual experience at least on an annual basis and concurrent with changes to cash flow assumptions. When net premiums are updated for cash flow changes, the estimated cash flows over the entire life of a group of contracts are updated using historical experience and updated future cash flow assumptions. The revised net premiums are used to calculate an updated liability for future policy benefits as of the beginning of the reporting period, discounted at the original locked in rate (i.e., contract issuance rate). The updated liability for future policy benefits as of the beginning of the reporting period is then compared with the carrying amount of the liability as of that date prior to updating cash flow assumptions to determine the current period remeasurement gain or loss reflected in current period earnings. The revised net premiums are then applied as of the beginning of the quarter to calculate the benefit expense for the current reporting period. The difference between the updated carrying amount of the liability for future policy benefits measured using the current discount rate assumption and the original discount rate assumption is recognized in OCI. The interest accretion rate remains the original discount rate used at contract issue date. If the updating of cash flow assumptions results in the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeding the present value of future gross premiums, a charge to net income is recorded for the current reporting period such that net premiums are set equal to gross premiums. In subsequent periods, the liability for future policy benefits is accrued with net premiums set equal to gross premiums. Contracts (except for life contingent payout annuities sold subsequent to December 31, 2020) are grouped into cohorts by contract type and issue year, as well as by legal entity and reportable segment. Life contingent payout annuities sold in periods beginning in 2021 are grouped into quarterly cohorts. See Note 11 for information regarding the liabilities for traditional long-duration products. Deferred Profit Liability For limited-payment products, gross premiums received in excess of net premiums are deferred at initial recognition as a deferred profit liability (DPL). Gross premiums are measured using assumptions consistent with those used in the measurement of the liability for future policy benefits, including discount rate, mortality, lapses and expenses. The DPL is amortized and recognized as premium revenue in proportion to expected future benefit payments from annuity contracts. Interest is accreted on the balance of the DPL using the discount rate determined at contract issuance. The Company reviews and updates its estimate of cash flows from the DPL at the same time as the estimates of cash flows for the liability for future policy benefits. When cash flows are updated, the updated estimates are used to recalculate the DPL at contract issuance. The recalculated DPL as of the beginning of the current reporting period is compared to the carrying amount of the DPL as of the beginning of the current reporting period, and any difference is recognized as either a charge or credit to premium revenue. DPL is recorded in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims and included as a reconciling item within Note 11. Unearned Revenue Liability The Companys UL and VUL policies require payment of fees or other policyholder assessments in advance for services to be provided in future periods. These charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized consistent with DAC amortization factors. The unearned revenue liability is recorded in Other liabilities and the amortization is recorded in Premiums, policy and contract charges. For clients who pay financial planning fees prior to the advisors delivery of the financial plan, the financial planning fees received in advance are deferred as unearned revenue until the plan is delivered to the client. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Excess tax benefits or deficiencies are created upon distribution or exercise of awards and are recognized within the Income tax provision. The fair value of each option is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of performance share units granted to the Companys Executive Leadership Team on a fair value basis until fully vested. Income Taxes The Companys provision for income taxes represents the net amount of income taxes that the Company expects to pay or to receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company provides for income taxes based on amounts that the Company believes it will ultimately owe taking into account the recognition and measurement for uncertain tax positions. Inherent in 89 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items. In connection with the provision for income taxes, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of its deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established and the amount of such allowance if required. Factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. Consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination: (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (iv) tax planning strategies. Management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure its ability to realize deferred tax assets and reduce the likelihood of the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets. With respect to the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT), we have adopted a policy of excluding future years CAMT as a consideration within the Companys valuation allowance analysis. See Note 24 for additional information on the Companys valuation allowance. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates and the effect is included in income. Revenue Recognition Mortality and expense risk fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the fair value of assets held in separate accounts and recognized when assessed. Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which makes an adjustment of the yield for security premiums and discounts on all performing fixed maturity securities classified as Available-for-Sale so that the related security or loan recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. When actual prepayments differ significantly from originally anticipated prepayments, the retrospective effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and updated future payment assumptions and a catch-up adjustment is recorded in the current period. In addition, the new effective yield, which reflects anticipated future payments, is used prospectively. Realized gains and losses on securities, other than trading securities and equity method investments, are recognized using the specific identification method on a trade date basis. Premiums on traditional life, DI and LTC insurance and life contingent payout annuities are net of reinsurance ceded and are recognized as revenue when due. Variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and cost of insurance charges on UL and VUL insurance and contract charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for UL insurance products) and surrender charges on annuities and UL and VUL insurance are recognized as revenue when assessed. See Note 4 for further discussion of accounting policies on revenue from contracts with customers. 3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adoption of New Accounting Standards Financial Instruments  Credit Losses  Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed amendments to ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). The update removes the recognition and measurement guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, ReceivablesTroubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, and modifies the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Rather than applying the recognition and measurement for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The update also requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial InstrumentsCredit LossesMeasured at Amortized Cost. The amendments are to be applied prospectively, but entities may apply a modified retrospective transition for changes to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. For entities that have adopted Topic 326, the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition and modifications to disclosures are immaterial in the current period. Business Combinations  Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers In October 2021, the FASB updated the accounting standards to require an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue for Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). At the acquisition date, an acquirer is required to account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 90 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 606 as if it had originated the contracts. Generally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquirees financial statements (if the acquiree prepared financial statements in accordance with GAAP). The amendments apply to all contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination that result from contracts accounted for under the principals of Topic 606. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Financial Services  Insurance  Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts In August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standard related to long-duration insurance contracts (ASU 2018-12). The guidance changes elements of the measurement models and disclosure requirements for an insurers long-duration insurance contract benefits and acquisition costs by expanding the use of fair value accounting to certain contract benefits, requiring updates, if any, and at least annually, to assumptions used to measure liabilities for future policy benefits, changing the amortization pattern of deferred acquisition costs to a constant-level basis and removing certain shadow adjustments previously recorded in AOCI. Adoption of the accounting standard did not impact overall cash flows, insurance subsidiaries dividend capacity, or regulatory capital requirements. When the Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023 with a transition date of January 1, 2021 (the transition date), opening equity was adjusted for the adoption impacts to retained earnings and AOCI and prior periods presented (i.e. 2021 and 2022) were restated. The adoption impact as of January 1, 2021 was a reduction in total equity of $ 1.9 billion, of which $ 0.9 billion and $ 1.0 billion were reflected in retained earnings and AOCI, respectively. The following table presents the effects of the adoption of the above new accounting standard to the Companys previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets: As Filed December 31, 2022 Adjustment Post-adoption December 31, 2022 As Filed December 31, 2021 Adjustment Post-adoption December 31, 2021 (in millions) Assets Market risk benefits $  $ 1,015 $ 1,015 $  $ 539 $ 539 Receivables (allowance for credit losses: 2022, $ 75 ; 2021, $ 55 ) 15,779 ( 184 ) 15,595 16,205 927 17,132 Deferred acquisition costs 3,160 ( 383 ) 2,777 2,782 62 2,844 Other assets 9,341 ( 64 ) 9,277 11,375 297 11,672 Total assets $ 158,468 $ 384 $ 158,852 $ 175,910 $ 1,825 $ 177,735 Liabilities and Equity Liabilities: Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims $ 36,067 $ ( 1,935 ) $ 34,132 $ 35,750 $ ( 727 ) $ 35,023 Market risk benefits  2,118 2,118  3,440 3,440 Other liabilities 6,305 11 6,316 8,641 216 8,857 Total liabilities 154,855 194 155,049 169,969 2,929 172,898 Equity: Retained earnings 19,531 387 19,918 17,525 ( 203 ) 17,322 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 2,349 ) ( 197 ) ( 2,546 ) 259 ( 901 ) ( 642 ) Total equity 3,613 190 3,803 5,941 ( 1,104 ) 4,837 Total liabilities and equity $ 158,468 $ 384 $ 158,852 $ 175,910 $ 1,825 $ 177,735 91 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Leases  Common Control Arrangements In March 2023, the FASB proposed amendments to ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The update applicable to all entities requires leasehold improvements associated with common control leases to be amortized over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease and to be accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if, and when, the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company early adopted the update during the second quarter of 2023 and will apply the amendments prospectively as of the beginning of 2023 to all new and existing leasehold improvements recognized on or after that date with any remaining unamortized balance of existing leasehold improvements amortized over their remaining useful life to the common control group determined at that date. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards Segment Reporting  Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , updating reportable segment disclosure requirements in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss and contain other disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing changes to the segment related disclosures resulting from the standard. The adoption of the standard will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition as the standard is disclosure-related only. 92 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Income Taxes  Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , updating the accounting standards related to income tax disclosures, primarily focused on the disaggregation of income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation table. The standard is to be applied prospectively with an option for retrospective application and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing changes to the income tax related disclosures resulting from the standard. The adoption of the standard will not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition as the standard is disclosure-related only. 4.

The amounts primarily consist of revenue associated with insurance and annuity products and investment income from financial instruments. The following discussion describes the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from the Companys contracts with customers on a consolidated basis. Management and Financial Advice Fees Asset Management Fees The Company earns revenue for performing asset management services for retail and institutional clients. The revenue is earned based on a fixed or tiered rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management. Assets under management vary with market fluctuations and client behavior. The asset management performance obligation is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Asset management fees are accrued, invoiced and collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. The Companys asset management contracts for Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Société d'Investissement à Capital Variable (SICAVs) in Europe include performance obligations for asset management and fund distribution services. The amounts received for these services are reported as Management and financial advice fees. The revenue recognition pattern is the same for both performance obligations as the fund distribution services revenue is variably constrained due to factors outside the Companys control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment) and not recognized until assets under management are known. The Company may also earn performance-based management fees on institutional accounts, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), OEICs, SICAVs and property and other funds based on a percentage of account returns in excess of either a benchmark index or a contractually specified level. This revenue is variable and impacted primarily by the performance of the assets being managed compared to the benchmark index or contractually specified level. The revenue is not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Performance-based management fees are invoiced on a quarterly or annual basis. 95 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Advisory Fees The Company earns revenue for performing investment advisory services for certain brokerage customers discretionary and non-discretionary managed accounts. The revenue is earned based on a contractual fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets held in the account. The investment advisory performance obligation is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Advisory fees are billed on a monthly basis on the prior month end assets. Financial Planning Fees The Company earns revenue for providing financial plans to its clients. The revenue earned for each financial plan is either a fixed fee (received monthly, quarterly or annually) or a variable fee (received monthly) based on a contractual fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the prior month end assets held in a clients investment advisory account. The financial planning fee is based on the complexity of a clients financial and life situation and his or her advisors experience. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time the financial plan is delivered to the customer. The Company records a contract liability for the unearned revenue when cash is received before the plan is delivered. The financial plan contracts with clients are annual contracts. Amounts recorded as a contract liability are recognized as revenue when the financial plan is delivered, which occurs within the annual contract period. For fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized when the financial plan is delivered. The Company accrues revenue for any amounts that have not been received at the time the financial plan is delivered. For variable fee arrangements, revenue is recognized for cash that has been received when the financial plan is delivered. The amount received after the plan is delivered is variably constrained due to factors outside the Companys control including market volatility and client behavior. The revenue is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur and is generally each month end as the advisory account balance uncertainty is resolved. Contract liabilities for financial planning fees, which are included in Other liabilities, were $ 168 million and $ 160 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company pays sales commissions to advisors when a new financial planning contract is obtained or when an existing contract is renewed. The sales commissions paid to the advisors prior to financial plan delivery are considered costs to obtain a contract with a customer and are initially capitalized. When the performance obligation to deliver the financial plan is satisfied, the commission is recognized as distribution expense. Capitalized costs to obtain these contracts are reported in Other assets, and were $ 135 million and $ 129 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Transaction and Other Fees The Company earns revenue for providing customer support, shareholder and administrative services (including transfer agent services) for affiliated mutual funds and networking, sub-accounting and administrative services for unaffiliated mutual funds. The Company also receives revenue for providing custodial services and account maintenance services on brokerage and retirement accounts that are not included in an advisory relationship. Transfer agent and administrative revenue is earned based on either a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Networking and sub-accounting revenue is earned based on either an annual fixed fee for each account or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Custodial and account maintenance revenue is generally earned based on a quarterly or annual fixed fee for each account. Each of the customer support and administrative services performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Transaction and other fees (other than custodial service fees) are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis. Custodial service fees are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on an annual basis. The Company earns revenue for providing trade execution services to franchise advisors. The trade execution performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each trade and the revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee per trade. These fees are invoiced and collected on a semi-monthly basis. Distribution Fees Mutual Funds and Insurance and Annuity Products The Company earns revenue for selling affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities and insurance products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally earned based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the net asset value of the fund, or the value of the insurance policy or annuity contract. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Companys control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment, insurance policy or annuity contract). This ongoing revenue may be recognized for many years after the initial sale. The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. 96 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The Company earns revenue for providing unaffiliated partners an opportunity to educate the Companys advisors or to support availability and distribution of their products on the Companys platforms. These payments allow the outside parties to train and support the advisors, explain the features of their products and distribute marketing and educational materials, and support trading and operational systems necessary to enable the Companys client servicing and production distribution efforts. The Company earns revenue for placing and maintaining unaffiliated fund partners and insurance companies products on the Companys sales platform (subject to the Companys due diligence standards). The revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee or a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets invested. These performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. These fees are invoiced and collected on monthly basis. Off-Balance Sheet Brokerage Cash The Company earns revenue for placing clients deposits in its brokerage sweep program with third-party banks. The amount received from the third-party banks is impacted by short-term interest rates. The performance obligation with the financial institutions that participate in the sweep program is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The revenue is earned daily and settled monthly based on a rate applied, as a percentage, to the deposits placed. Other Products The Company earns revenue for selling unaffiliated alternative products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment and is earned generally based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of the investment. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Companys control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment). The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company earns revenue from brokerage clients for the execution of requested trades. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of trade execution and amounts are received on the settlement date. The revenue varies for each trade based on various factors that include the type of investment, dollar amount of the trade and how the trade is executed (online or broker assisted). Other Revenues The Company earns revenue from fees charged to franchise advisors for providing various services the advisors need to manage and grow their practices. The primary services include: licensing of intellectual property and software, compliance supervision, insurance coverage, technology services and support, consulting and other services. The services are either provided by the Company or third- party providers. The Company controls the services provided by third parties as it has the right to direct the third parties to perform the services, is primarily responsible for performing the services and sets the prices the advisors are charged. The Company recognizes revenue for the gross amount of the fees received from the advisors. The fees are primarily collected monthly as a reduction of commission payments. Intellectual property and software licenses, along with compliance supervision, insurance coverage, and technology services and support are primarily earned based on a monthly fixed fee. These services are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The consulting and other services performance obligations are satisfied as the services are delivered and revenue is earned based upon the level of service requested. Contract Costs Asset The Company has an asset of $ 25 million and $ 33 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the transition of investment advisory services under an arrangement with BMO Financial Group for clients that elected to transfer U.S. retail and institutional assets to the Company. Receivables Receivables for revenue from contracts with customers are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and the Company has an unconditional right to the revenue. Receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers were $ 537 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 5. Variable Interest Entities The Company provides asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds and other private funds, property funds, and certain non-U.S. series funds (such as OEICs and SICAVs) (collectively, investment entities), which are sponsored by the Company. In addition, the Company invests in structured investments other than CLOs and certain affordable housing partnerships which are considered VIEs. The Company consolidates certain investment entities (collectively, consolidated investment entities) if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company has no obligation to provide financial or other support to the non-consolidated VIEs beyond its initial investment and existing future funding commitments, and the Company has not provided any additional support to these entities. The Company has unfunded commitments related to consolidated CLOs of $ 24 million and $ 30 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 2 for further discussion of the Companys accounting policy on consolidation. 97 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Structured Investments The Company invests in structured investments which are considered VIEs for which it is not the sponsor. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income instruments and are managed by third parties and include asset backed securities and commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the size of the Companys investment in the entities and position in the capital structure of these entities. Additionally, the Company invests in CLOs for which it is the sponsor. CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily syndicated loans and, to a lesser extent, high-yield bonds. Multiple tranches of debt securities are issued by a CLO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics. The debt securities issued by the CLOs are non-recourse to the Company. The CLOs debt holders have recourse only to the assets of the CLO. The assets of the CLOs cannot be used by the Company. Scheduled debt payments are based on the performance of the CLOs collateral pool. The Company earns management fees from the CLOs based on the value of the CLOs collateral pool and, in certain instances, may also receive incentive fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company has invested in a portion of the unrated, junior subordinated notes and highly rated senior notes of certain CLOs. The Company consolidates certain CLOs where it is the primary beneficiary and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLO. The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to structured investments and non-consolidated CLOs is limited to its amortized cost. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. See Note 6 for additional information on these investments. Other Non-Consolidated VIEs The Companys investments in other non-consolidated VIEs are recorded in other investments. The Companys maximum exposure to loss with respect to its investments in these non-consolidated VIEs is limited to its carrying value. The carrying value of other non-consolidated VIEs was $ 168 million and $ 174 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Companys liability related to original purchase commitments not yet remitted to the VIEs was not material as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has not provided any additional support to the VIEs beyond the funding commitments. Property Funds, Non-US Series Funds, Hedge Funds and other Private Funds The Company provides investment advice and other related services to property funds, non-U.S. series funds, hedge funds and other private funds, some of which are considered VIEs. For investment management services, the Company generally earns management fees based on the market value of assets under management, and in certain instances may also receive performance-based fees. The fee arrangements are at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company does not have a significant economic interest and is not required to consolidate any of these funds. Affordable Housing Partnerships and Other Real Estate Partnerships The Company is a limited partner in affordable housing partnerships that qualify for government-sponsored low income housing tax credit programs and partnerships that invest in multi-family residential properties that were originally developed with an affordable housing component. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate these partnerships. A majority of the limited partnerships are VIEs. 98 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. See Note 16 for the definition of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities held by consolidated investment entities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets Investments: Corporate debt securities $  $ 40 $  $ 40 Common stocks  5  5 Syndicated loans  1,991 63 2,054 Total investments  2,036 63 2,099 Receivables  28  28 Other assets  1  1 Total assets at fair value $  $ 2,065 $ 63 $ 2,128 Liabilities Debt (1) $  $ 2,155 $  $ 2,155 Other liabilities  45  45 Total liabilities at fair value $  $ 2,200 $  $ 2,200 December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Assets Investments: Corporate debt securities $  $ 35 $  $ 35 Common stocks  3  3 Syndicated loans  2,191 125 2,316 Total investments  2,229 125 2,354 Receivables  20  20 Other assets  1 1 2 Total assets at fair value $  $ 2,250 $ 126 $ 2,376 Liabilities Debt (1) $  $ 2,363 $  $ 2,363 Other liabilities  119  119 Total liabilities at fair value $  $ 2,482 $  $ 2,482 (1) The carrying value of the CLOs debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs assets. The estimated fair value of the CLOs debt was $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 99 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The following tables provide a summary of changes in Level 3 assets held by consolidated investment entities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Syndicated Loans Other Assets (in millions) Balance at January 1, 2023 $ 125 $ 1 Total gains (losses) included in: Net income ( 4 ) (1)  Purchases 45  Sales ( 10 )  Settlements ( 16 )  Transfers into Level 3 122  Transfers out of Level 3 ( 199 ) ( 1 ) Balance at December 31, 2023 $ 63 $  Changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in net income relating to assets held at December 31, 2023 $ ( 1 ) (1) $  Common Stocks Syndicated Loans Other Assets (in millions) Balance at January 1, 2022 $  $ 64 $ 3 Total gains (losses) included in: Net income  ( 11 ) (1)  Purchases  69  Sales  ( 4 )  Settlements  ( 8 )  Transfers into Level 3 2 218 1 Transfers out of Level 3 ( 2 ) ( 203 ) ( 3 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $  $ 125 $ 1 Changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in net income relating to assets held at December 31, 2022 $  $ ( 10 ) (1) $  Syndicated Loans Other Assets (in millions) Balance at January 1, 2021 $ 92 $ 2 Total gains (losses) included in: Net income 2 (1) 1 (1) Purchases 106  Sales ( 38 )  Settlements ( 49 )  Transfers into Level 3 119 2 Transfers out of Level 3 ( 150 ) ( 2 ) Deconsolidation of consolidated investment entities ( 18 )  Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 64 $ 3 Changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in net income relating to assets held at December 31, 2021 $  $ 1 (1) (1) Included in Net investment income. Securities and loans transferred from Level 3 primarily represent assets with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs or priced in active markets. Securities and loans transferred to Level 3 represent assets with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote. 100 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) All Level 3 measurements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company. Determination of Fair Value Assets Investments The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services using a market approach with observable inputs is classified as Level 2. The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services with a single non-binding broker quote as the underlying valuation source is classified as Level 3. The underlying inputs used in non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. See Note 16 for a description of the Companys determination of the fair value of corporate debt securities, common stocks and other investments. Receivables For receivables of the consolidated CLOs, the carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these assets has historically been short-term and the receivables have been collectible. The fair value of these receivables is classified as Level 2. Liabilities Debt The fair value of the CLOs assets, typically syndicated bank loans, is more observable than the fair value of the CLOs debt tranches for which market activity is limited and less transparent. As a result, the fair value of the CLOs debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs assets and is classified as Level 2. Other Liabilities Other liabilities consist primarily of securities purchased but not yet settled held by consolidated CLOs. The carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these liabilities has historically been short-term. The fair value of these liabilities is classified as Level 2. Other liabilities also include accrued interest on CLO debt. Fair Value Option The Company has elected the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLOs. Management believes that the use of the fair value option better matches the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CLOs. The following table presents the fair value and unpaid principal balance of loans and debt for which the fair value option has been elected: December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Syndicated loans Unpaid principal balance $ 2,190 $ 2,525 Excess unpaid principal over fair value ( 136 ) ( 209 ) Fair value $ 2,054 $ 2,316 Fair value of loans more than 90 days past due $  $  Fair value of loans in nonaccrual status 13 23 Difference between fair value and unpaid principal of loans more than 90 days past due, loans in nonaccrual status or both 40 48 Debt Unpaid principal balance $ 2,362 $ 2,636 Excess unpaid principal over fair value ( 207 ) ( 273 ) Carrying value (1) $ 2,155 $ 2,363 (1) The carrying value of the CLOs debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs assets. The estimated fair value of the CLOs debt was $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest income from syndicated loans, bonds and structured investments is recorded based on contractual rates in Net investment income. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments and gains and losses on sales of investments are also recorded in Net investment income. Interest expense on debt is recorded in Interest and debt expense with gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of debt recorded in Net investment income. 101 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Total net gains (losses) recognized in Net investment income related to the changes in fair value of investments the Company owns in the consolidated CLOs where it has elected the fair value option and collateralized financing entity accounting were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Debt of the consolidated investment entities and the stated interest rates were as follows: Carrying Value Weighted Average Interest Rate December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Debt of consolidated CLOs due 2028 -2034 $ 2,155 $ 2,363 6.6 % 5.3 % The debt of the consolidated CLOs has both fixed and floating interest rates, which range from nil to 14.8 %. The interest rates on the debt of CLOs are weighted average rates based on the outstanding principal and contractual interest rates. 6.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, fixed maturity securities comprised approximately 93 % and 92 %, respectively, of Ameriprise Financial investments. Rating agency designations are based on the availability of ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch). The Company uses the median of available ratings from Moodys, S&P and Fitch, or if fewer than three ratings are available, the lower rating is used. When ratings from Moodys, S&P and Fitch are unavailable, the Company may utilize ratings from other NRSROs or rate the securities internally. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Companys internal analysts rated $ 282 million and $ 270 million, respectively, of securities using criteria similar to those used by NRSROs. A summary of fixed maturity securities by rating was as follows: December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Ratings Amortized Cost Fair Value Percent of Total Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Percent of Total Fair Value (in millions, except percentages) AAA $ 25,235 $ 24,342 47 % $ 30,900 $ 28,980 71 % AA 14,013 13,534 26 1,219 1,249 3 A 3,073 3,139 6 2,080 2,097 5 BBB 10,396 10,216 20 8,524 7,890 19 Below investment grade (1) 331 331 1 661 595 2 Total fixed maturities $ 53,048 $ 51,562 100 % $ 43,384 $ 40,811 100 % (1) The amortized cost of below investment grade securities includes interest in non-consolidated CLOs managed by the Company of $ 1 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of below investment grade securities includes interest in non-consolidated CLOs managed by the Company of $ 1 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. These securities are not rated but are included in below investment grade due to their risk characteristics. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 83 % of securities rated AA were GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC mortgage backed securities. These issuers were downgraded in the third quarter of 2023 from AAA to AA due to the downgrade of the U.S. Government long-term credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30 % of securities rated AAA were GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC mortgage backed securities. No holdings of any issuer were greater than 10% of the Companys total equity as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 103 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The following tables summarize the fair value and gross unrealized losses on Available-for-Sale securities, aggregated by major investment type and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for which no allowance for credit losses has been recorded: December 31, 2023 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in millions, except number of securities) Corporate debt securities 97 $ 1,276 $ ( 11 ) 376 $ 5,197 $ ( 496 ) 473 $ 6,473 $ ( 507 ) Residential mortgage backed securities 82 3,052 ( 25 ) 734 10,677 ( 1,146 ) 816 13,729 ( 1,171 ) Commercial mortgage backed securities 31 747 ( 9 ) 277 4,092 ( 332 ) 308 4,839 ( 341 ) Asset backed securities 49 885 ( 2 ) 116 2,840 ( 57 ) 165 3,725 ( 59 ) State and municipal obligations 5 29 ( 1 ) 49 138 ( 19 ) 54 167 ( 20 ) U.S. government and agency obligations 11 955  1   12 955  Foreign government bonds and obligations    3 12 ( 1 ) 3 12 ( 1 ) Total 275 $ 6,944 $ ( 48 ) 1,556 $ 22,956 $ ( 2,051 ) 1,831 $ 29,900 $ ( 2,099 ) December 31, 2022 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in millions, except number of securities) Corporate debt securities 457 $ 5,782 $ ( 458 ) 108 $ 1,575 $ ( 365 ) 565 $ 7,357 $ ( 823 ) Residential mortgage backed securities 589 9,407 ( 577 ) 244 4,076 ( 813 ) 833 13,483 ( 1,390 ) Commercial mortgage backed securities 249 3,857 ( 220 ) 101 1,802 ( 219 ) 350 5,659 ( 439 ) Asset backed securities 145 4,413 ( 86 ) 31 977 ( 72 ) 176 5,390 ( 158 ) State and municipal obligations 48 134 ( 16 ) 27 60 ( 11 ) 75 194 ( 27 ) U.S. government and agency obligations 13 566 ( 1 )    13 566 ( 1 ) Foreign government bonds and obligations 11 37 ( 2 ) 1 1  12 38 ( 2 ) Total 1,512 $ 24,196 $ ( 1,360 ) 512 $ 8,491 $ ( 1,480 ) 2,024 $ 32,687 $ ( 2,840 ) As part of the Companys ongoing monitoring process, management determined that the decrease in gross unrealized losses on its Available-for-Sale securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to the impact of lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. The Company did not recognize these unrealized losses in earnings because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 96 % and 95 %, respectively, of the total of Available-for-Sale securities with gross unrealized losses were considered investment grade. 104 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Credit Quality Information Nonperforming loans were $ 12 million and $ 11 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All other loans were considered to be performing. Commercial Loans Commercial Mortgage Loans The Company reviews the credit worthiness of the borrower and the performance of the underlying properties in order to determine the risk of loss on commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratio is the primary credit quality indicator included in this review. Based on this review, the commercial mortgage loans are assigned an internal risk rating, which management updates when credit risk changes. Commercial mortgage loans which management has assigned its highest risk rating were less than 1% of total commercial mortgage loans as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Loans with the highest risk rating represent distressed loans which the Company has identified as impaired or expects to become delinquent or enter into foreclosure within the next six months. There were no commercial mortgage loans past due as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 106 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Repayment of the loan is highly dependent on the retention of the financial advisor. In the event a financial advisor is no longer affiliated with the Company, any unpaid balances become immediately due. Accordingly, the primary risk factor for advisor loans is termination status. The allowance for credit losses related to loans to advisors that have terminated their relationship with the Company was $ 7 million and $ 6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, write-offs of advisor loans were not material.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Margin Loans The margin loans balance was $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company monitors collateral supporting margin loans and requests additional collateral when necessary in order to mitigate the risk of loss. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no allowance for credit losses on margin loans. Pledged Asset Lines of Credit The pledged asset lines of credit balance was $ 537 million and $ 589 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Based on managements evaluation of the collateral value relative to the deposit receivables, the allowance for credit losses for deposit receivables was not material as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Modifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Modifications of financing receivables with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by the Company were not material during the year ended December 31, 2023. 8. Reinsurance The Company reinsures a portion of the insurance risks associated with its traditional life, DI and LTC insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life) reinsures 100 % of its insurance risk associated with its life contingent payout annuity policies in force as of June 30, 2021 through a reinsurance agreement with Global Atlantic Financial Groups subsidiary Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Policies issued on or after July 1, 2021 and policies issued by RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (RiverSource Life of NY) are not subject to this reinsurance agreement. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its primary obligation to policyholders. The Company generally reinsures 90 % of the death benefit liability for new term life insurance policies beginning in 2001 and new individual UL and VUL insurance policies beginning in 2002. Policies issued prior to these dates are not subject to these same reinsurance levels. However, for IUL policies issued after September 1, 2013 and VUL policies issued after January 1, 2014, the Company generally reinsures 50 % of the death benefit liability. Similarly, the Company reinsures 50 % of the death benefit and morbidity liabilities related to its UL product with LTC benefits. The maximum amount of life insurance risk the Company will retain is $ 10 million on a single life and $ 10 million on any flexible premium survivorship life policy; however, reinsurance agreements are in place such that retaining more than $ 1.5 million of insurance risk on a single life or a flexible premium survivorship life policy is very unusual. Risk on UL and VUL policies is reinsured on a yearly renewable term basis. Risk on most term life policies starting in 2001 is reinsured on a coinsurance basis, a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurer participates proportionally in all material risks and premiums associated with a policy. For existing LTC policies, the Company has continued ceding 50 % of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only, which are 89 % of the total RiverSource Life of NY in force policies. Under these agreements, the Company has the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth. Generally, the Company retains at most $ 5,000 per month of risk per life on DI policies sold on policy forms introduced in most states starting in 2007 and reinsures the remainder of the risk on a coinsurance basis with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. The Company retains all risk for new claims on DI contracts sold on other policy forms introduced prior to 2007. The Company also retains all risk on accidental death benefit claims and substantially all risk associated with waiver of premium provisions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, traditional life and UL insurance policies in force were $ 198.8 billion and $ 198.9 billion, respectively, of which $ 144.7 billion and $ 146.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were reinsured at the respective year ends. 110 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The effect of reinsurance on premiums for traditional long-duration products was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Direct premiums $ 674 $ 530 $ 490 Reinsurance ceded ( 226 ) ( 224 ) ( 1,361 ) Net premiums $ 448 $ 306 $ ( 871 ) Cost of insurance and administrative charges for non-traditional long-duration products are reflected in Premiums, policy and contract charges and were net of reinsurance ceded of $ 180 million, $ 165 million and $ 152 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of claims recovered through reinsurance on all contracts was $ 438 million, $ 435 million and $ 404 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Receivables included $ 4.3 billion and $ 4.2 billion of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, including $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.7 billion related to LTC risk ceded to Genworth, respectively. Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims include $ 376 million and $ 388 million related to previously assumed reinsurance arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 9.

A vast majority of the premiums received for variable annuity contracts are held in separate accounts where the assets are held for the exclusive benefit of those contractholders. Most of the variable annuity contracts issued by the Company contain a GMDB. The Company previously offered contracts with GMAB, GMWB, and GMIB provisions. See Note 2 and Note 13 for additional information regarding the Companys variable annuity guarantees. See Note 16 and Note 18 for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments used to hedge risks related to these guarantees. Structured Variable Annuities Structured variable annuities provide contractholders the option to allocate a portion of their account value to an indexed account held in a non-insulated separate account with the contractholders rate of return, which may be positive or negative, tied to selected indices. The amount allocated by a contractholder to the indexed account creates an embedded derivative which is measured at fair value. The Company hedges the equity and interest rate risk related to the indexed account with freestanding derivative instruments. Fixed Annuities Fixed annuities include deferred, payout and fixed deferred indexed annuity contracts. In 2020, the Company discontinued sales of fixed deferred and fixed deferred indexed annuities. Deferred contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of interest and security of the principal invested. Payout contracts guarantee a fixed income payment for life or the term of the contract. Liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates. The Companys fixed index annuity product is a fixed annuity that includes an indexed account. The rate of interest credited above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the specific index for the indexed 114 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) account (subject to a cap). The amount allocated by a contractholder to the indexed account creates an embedded derivative which is measured at fair value. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments used to hedge the risk related to indexed accounts. Insurance Liabilities UL policies accumulate cash value that increases by a fixed interest rate. Purchasers of VUL can select from a variety of investment options and can elect to allocate a portion of their account balance to a fixed account or a separate account. A vast majority of the premiums received for VUL policies are held in separate accounts where the assets are held for the exclusive benefit of those policyholders. IUL is a UL policy that includes an indexed account. The rate of credited interest for funds allocated by a contractholder to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the specific index for the indexed account (subject to stated account parameters, which include a cap and floor, or a spread). The policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account. The amount allocated by a contractholder to the indexed account creates an embedded derivative which is measured at fair value. The Company hedges the interest credited rate including equity and interest rate risk related to the indexed account with freestanding derivative instruments. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments used to hedge the risk related to IUL. The Company also offers term life insurance as well as DI products. The Company no longer offers standalone LTC products and whole life insurance but has in force policies from prior years. Insurance liabilities include accumulation values, incurred but not reported claims, obligations for anticipated future claims, unpaid reported claims and claim adjustment expenses. 115 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

For VA and VUL, the cash surrender value shown is the proportion of the total cash surrender value related to their fixed account liabilities. Refer to Note 13 for the net amount at risk for market risk benefits associated with variable and structured variable annuities. Fixed, fixed indexed, and non-life contingent payout annuities do not have net amount at risk in excess of account value. Net amount at risk for insurance products is calculated as the death benefit amount in excess of applicable account values, host, embedded derivative, and separate account liabilities. 117 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Impacts of the annual review of policy benefit reserves assumptions are reflected within the effect of changes in cash flow assumptions in the disaggregated rollforwards above. The annual review of policy benefit reserves assumptions in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net decrease in future policy benefit reserves, primarily due to updates to LTC premium rate increase assumptions. The annual review of policy benefit reserves assumptions in the third quarter of 2022 resulted in a net decrease in future policy benefit reserves, primarily due to updates to LTC morbidity, premium rate increase and benefit reduction assumptions, and updates to Term Life lapse assumptions. The annual review of policy benefit reserves assumptions in the third quarter of 2021 resulted in a net decrease in future policy benefit reserves, primarily due to updates to LTC premium rate increase and benefit reduction assumptions.

Market Risk Benefits Market risk benefits are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. Most of the variable annuity contracts issued by the Company contain a GMDB provision. The Company previously offered contracts containing GMWB, GMAB, or GMIB provisions. The GMDB provisions provide a specified minimum return upon death of the contractholder. The death benefit payable is the greater of (i) the contract value less any purchase payment credits subject to recapture less a pro-rata portion of any rider fees, or (ii) the GMDB provisions specified in the contract. The Company has the following primary GMDB provisions:  Return of premium  provides purchase payments minus adjusted partial surrenders.  Reset  provides that the value resets to the account value at specified contract anniversary intervals minus adjusted partial surrenders. This provision was often provided in combination with the return of premium provision and is no longer offered.  Ratchet  provides that the value ratchets up to the maximum account value at specified anniversary intervals, plus subsequent purchase payments less adjusted partial surrenders. The variable annuity contracts with GMWB riders typically have account values that are based on an underlying portfolio of mutual funds, the values of which fluctuate based on fund performance. At contract issue, the guaranteed amount is equal to the amount deposited but the guarantee may be increased annually to the account value (a step-up) in the case of favorable market performance or by a benefit credit if the contract includes this provision. 127 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The Company has GMWB riders in force, which contain one or more of the following provisions:  Withdrawals at a specified rate per year until the amount withdrawn is equal to the guaranteed amount.  Withdrawals at a specified rate per year for the life of the contractholder (GMWB for life).  Withdrawals at a specified rate per year for joint contractholders while either is alive.  Withdrawals based on performance of the contract.  Withdrawals based on the age withdrawals begin.  Credits are applied annually for a specified number of years to increase the guaranteed amount as long as withdrawals have not been taken. Variable annuity contractholders age 79 or younger at contract issue could obtain a principal-back guarantee by purchasing the optional GMAB rider for an additional charge. The GMAB rider guarantees that, regardless of market performance at the end of the 10-year waiting period, the contract value will be no less than the original investment or a specified percentage of the highest anniversary value, adjusted for withdrawals. If the contract value is less than the guarantee at the end of the 10-year period, a lump sum will be added to the contract value to make the contract value equal to the guarantee value. Individual variable annuity contracts may have both a death benefit and a living benefit. Net amount at risk is quantified for each benefit and a composite net amount at risk is calculated using the greater of the death benefit or living benefit for each individual contract. The net amount at risk for GMDB and GMAB is defined as the current guaranteed benefit amount in excess of the current contract value. The net amount at risk for GMIB is defined as the greater of the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments less the current contract value or zero. The net amount at risk for GMWB is defined as the greater of the present value of the minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments less the current contract value or zero.

These updates resulted in the following notable changes in the fair value estimates of market risk benefits calculations: Year ended December 31, 2023  Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawals assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of $ 18 million.  Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of $ 110 million. Year ended December 31, 2022  Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawals assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of $ 39 million.  Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of $ 200 million.  Updates to mortality assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of $ 49 million. Refer to the rollforward of market risk benefits for the impacts of changes to interest rate, equity market, volatility and nonperformance risk assumptions. Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Significant increases (decreases) in utilization and volatility used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value. Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender assumptions used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. Significant increases (decreases) in mortality assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the death benefit portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value whereas significant increases (decreases) in mortality rates used in the fair values measurement of the life contingent portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. Surrender assumptions, utilization assumptions and mortality assumptions vary with the type of base product, type of rider, duration of the policy, age of the contractholder, calender year of the projection, previous withdrawal history, and the relationship between the value of the guaranteed benefit and the contract accumulation value. Determination of Fair Value The Company values market risk benefits using internal valuation models. These models include observable capital market assumptions and significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility as well as contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk, all of which the Company believes a market participant would expect. The fair value also reflects a current estimate of the Companys nonperformance risk. Given the significant unobservable inputs to this valuation, these measurements are classified as Level 3. 130 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Customer Deposits Customer deposits consisted of the following: December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Fixed rate certificates $ 13,284 $ 9,080 Other 151 221 Total investment certificate reserves 13,435 9,301 Interest bearing checking 1,258 1,117 Money market 19,940 17,189 Savings 301  Brokerage deposits 2,387 3,168 Total banking and brokerage deposits 23,886 21,474 Total $ 37,321 $ 30,775 Investment Certificates The Company offers fixed rate investment certificates primarily in amounts ranging from $ 1 thousand to $ 2 million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from 3 to 36 months. Investment certificates may be purchased either with a lump sum payment or installment payments. Certificate owners are entitled to receive a fixed sum at either maturity or upon demand depending on the type of certificate. Payments from certificate owners are credited to investment certificate reserves, which generally accumulate interest at specified percentage rates. Certain investment certificates allow for a surrender charge on premature surrenders. Reserves for certificates that do not allow for a surrender charge were $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company generally invests the proceeds from investment certificates in fixed and variable rate securities. The interest paid to certificate owners is included in Banking and deposit interest expense. Banking and Brokerage Deposits Banking and brokerage deposits are amounts payable to customers related to funds deposited by customers in checking and savings, brokerage sweep balances, free credit balances, and funds accruing to customers as a result of trades or contracts. Money market deposits represent brokerage sweep for client balances held at Ameriprise Bank. Brokerage deposits primarily represent our clients free credit balances. The Company pays interest on certain customer deposit balances and the interest is included in Banking and deposit interest expense. 15. Debt The balances and stated interest rates of outstanding debt of Ameriprise Financial were as follows: Outstanding Balance Stated Interest Rate December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Long-term debt: Senior notes due 2023 $  $ 750  % 4.0 % Senior notes due 2024 550 550 3.7 3.7 Senior notes due 2025 500 500 3.0 3.0 Senior notes due 2026 500 500 2.9 2.9 Senior notes due 2028 600  5.7  Senior notes due 2032 500 500 4.5 4.5 Senior notes due 2033 750  5.2  Finance lease liabilities 20 30 N/A N/A Other (1) ( 21 ) ( 9 ) N/A N/A Total long-term debt 3,399 2,821 Short-term borrowings: Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances 201 201 5.6 % 4.6 % Total $ 3,600 $ 3,022 (1) Includes adjustments for net unamortized discounts, debt issuance costs and other lease obligations. N/A Not Applicable 131 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Long-Term Debt The Companys senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to the greater of the principal amount and the present value of remaining scheduled payments, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued interest. On March 9, 2023, the Company issued $ 750 million of 5.15 % unsecured senior notes due May 15, 2033 and incurred debt issuance costs of $ 7 million. Interest payments are due semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15, which commenced on November 15, 2023. On October 16, 2023, the Company repaid $ 750 million principal amount of its 4.0 % senior notes at maturity. On November 9, 2023, the Company issued $ 600 million of 5.7 % unsecured senior notes due December 15, 2028 and incurred debt issuance costs of $ 6 million. Interest payments are due semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, which commences on June 15, 2024. Short-Term Borrowings The Companys life insurance and bank subsidiaries are members of the FHLB of Des Moines which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Companys life insurance subsidiary had accessed collateralized borrowings and pledged (granted a lien on) certain investments, primarily commercial mortgage backed securities, with an aggregate fair value of $ 1.1 billion and $ 962 million, respectively. The remaining maturity of outstanding FHLB advances was less than three months as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The stated interest rate of the FHLB advances is a weighted average annualized interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of the balance sheet date. The Companys bank subsidiary had no outstanding obligations to the FHLB as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Companys bank subsidiary maintains access to collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no outstanding obligations to the Federal Reserve. In June 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $ 1.0 billion that expires in June 2026. Under the terms of the agreement for the facility, the Company may increase the amount of this facility up to $ 1.25 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Prior to June 21, 2023, the interest rate for any borrowing under the agreement was established by reference to London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for U.S. dollar deposits with maturities comparable to the relevant interest period, plus an applicable margin subject to adjustment based on debt ratings of the senior unsecured debt of the Company with an integrated hardwired approach to a fallback interest rate with certain hardwired credit spread adjustments. On June 21, 2023, in anticipation of the end of the publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR, an amendment to the agreement changed the interest rate from LIBOR for U.S. dollars to a Spread Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is defined as Term SOFR for an interest period selected by the Company plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 %, plus an applicable margin subject to adjustment based on debt ratings of the senior unsecured debt of the Company. In the event of default, an additional 2 % interest will accrue during such period of default. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and $ 1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. The Companys credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (AEIS), a subsidiary of the Company, has credit agreements for uncommitted lines of credit with third party financial institutions, having a combined credit limit of $ 500 million. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, AEIS had no borrowings outstanding . 16. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability is not exchanged subject to a forced liquidation or distressed sale. Valuation Hierarchy The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the Companys valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. Level 2 Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 132 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Significant increases (decreases) in the yield/spread to U.S. Treasuries used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 corporate debt securities in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the annual default rate and discount rate used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 asset backed securities in isolation, generally, would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement and significant increases (decreases) in loss recovery in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the constant prepayment rate in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the surrender assumption used in the fair value measurement of the fixed deferred indexed annuity ceded embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk used in the fair value measurement of the IUL embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender assumption used in the fair value measurements of the fixed deferred indexed annuity embedded derivatives and structured variable annuity embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Determination of Fair Value The Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market and income approaches to measure the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The Companys market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Companys income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future projected cash flows to a single discounted present value amount. When applying either approach, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. Assets Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less. Actively traded money market funds are measured at their NAV and classified as Level 1. U.S. Treasuries are also classified as Level 1. The Companys remaining cash equivalents are classified as Level 2 and measured at amortized cost, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short time between the purchase of the instrument and its expected realization. Investments (Available-for-Sale Securities, Equity Securities and Trading Securities) When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from third-party pricing services, non-binding broker quotes, or other model-based valuation techniques. Level 1 securities primarily include trading securities and U.S. Treasuries. Level 2 securities primarily include corporate bonds, residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, state and municipal obligations, foreign government securities and other securities. The fair value of these Level 2 securities is based on a market approach with prices obtained from third-party pricing services. Observable inputs used to value these securities can include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and non-binding broker quotes. The fair value of securities included in an observable transaction with a market participant are also considered Level 2 when the market is not active. Level 3 securities primarily include certain corporate bonds, non-agency residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities with fair value typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The underlying inputs used for some of the non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. The Companys privately placed corporate bonds are typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The fair value of certain asset backed securities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about discount rates and default, prepayment and recovery rates of the underlying assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement, the fair value of the investment in certain asset backed securities is classified as Level 3. Management is responsible for the fair values recorded on the financial statements. Prices received from third-party pricing services are subjected to exception reporting that identifies investments with significant daily price movements as well as no movements. The 139 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Company reviews the exception reporting and resolves the exceptions through reaffirmation of the price or recording an appropriate fair value estimate. The Company also performs subsequent transaction testing. The Company performs annual due diligence of third-party pricing services. The Companys due diligence procedures include assessing the vendors valuation qualifications, control environment, analysis of asset-class specific valuation methodologies, and understanding of sources of market observable assumptions and unobservable assumptions, if any, employed in the valuation methodology. The Company also considers the results of its exception reporting controls and any resulting price challenges that arise. Separate Account Assets The fair value of assets held by separate accounts is determined by the NAV of the funds in which those separate accounts are invested. The NAV is used as a practical expedient for fair value and represents the exit price for the separate account. Separate account assets are excluded from classification in the fair value hierarchy. Investments and Cash Equivalents Segregated for Regulatory Purposes Investments and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory purposes includes U.S. Treasuries that are classified as Level 1. Receivables The Company reinsured its fixed deferred indexed annuity products which have an indexed account that is accounted for as an embedded derivative. The Company uses discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of these ceded embedded derivatives. The fair value of fixed deferred indexed annuity ceded embedded derivatives includes significant observable interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels and significant unobservable surrender rates. Given the significance of the unobservable surrender rates, these embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3. Other Assets Derivatives that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, such as derivatives that are exchange-traded, are classified as Level 1 measurements. The variation margin on futures contracts is also classified as Level 1. The fair value of derivatives that are traded in less active over-the-counter (OTC) markets is generally measured using pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and equity index levels. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and include swaps, foreign currency forwards and the majority of options. The counterparties nonperformance risk associated with uncollateralized derivative assets was immaterial as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 17 and Note 18 for further information on the credit risk of derivative instruments and related collateral. Liabilities Policyholder Account Balances, Future Policy Benefits and Claims There is no active market for the transfer of the Companys embedded derivatives attributable to the provisions of fixed deferred indexed annuity, structured variable annuity and IUL products. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the provisions of its equity index annuity product. The projected cash flows generated by this model are based on significant observable inputs related to interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The Company uses discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the provisions of its fixed deferred indexed annuity, structured variable annuity and IUL products. The structured variable annuity product is a limited flexible purchase payment annuity that offers 45 different indexed account options providing equity market exposure and a fixed account. Each indexed account includes a protection option (a buffer or a floor). If the index has a negative return, contractholder losses will be reduced by a buffer or limited to a floor. The portion allocated to an indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative. The fair value of fixed deferred indexed annuity, structured variable annuity and IUL embedded derivatives includes significant observable interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels and significant unobservable surrender rates and the estimate of the Companys nonperformance risk. Given the significance of the unobservable surrender rates and the nonperformance risk assumption, the fixed deferred indexed annuity, structured variable annuity and IUL embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3. The embedded derivatives attributable to these provisions are recorded in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims. Customer Deposits The Company uses Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the provisions of its stock market certificates (SMC). The inputs to these calculations are primarily market observable and include interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels. As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 2. Other Liabilities Derivatives that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, such as derivatives that are exchange-traded, are classified as Level 1 measurements. The variation margin on futures contracts is also classified as Level 1. The fair value of derivatives that are traded in less active OTC markets is generally measured using pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and 140 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) equity index levels. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and include swaps, foreign currency forwards and the majority of options. The Companys nonperformance risk associated with uncollateralized derivative liabilities was immaterial as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 17 and Note 18 for further information on the credit risk of derivative instruments and related collateral. Securities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company to deliver specified securities that it does not yet own, creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from nationally-recognized pricing services, or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of cash flows. Level 1 securities sold but not yet purchased primarily include trading securities and U.S. Treasuries traded in active markets. Level 2 securities sold but not yet purchased primarily include corporate bonds. Contingent consideration liabilities consist of earn-outs and/or deferred payments related to the Companys acquisitions. Contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow model using an unobservable input (discount rate). Given the use of a significant unobservable input, the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company assesses its investment in affordable housing partnerships for impairment. The investments that are determined to be impaired are written down to their fair value. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to measure the fair value of these investments. Inputs to the discounted cash flow model are estimates of future net operating losses and tax credits available to the Company and discount rates based on market condition and the financial strength of the syndicator (general partner). The balance of affordable housing partnerships measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was $ 41 million and $ 58 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Assets and Liabilities Not Reported at Fair Value The following tables provide the carrying value and the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not reported at fair value: December 31, 2023 Carrying Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Financial Assets Mortgage loans, net $ 2,118 $  $ 280 $ 1,692 $ 1,972 Policy loans 912  912  912 Receivables 9,453 146 1,621 6,577 8,344 Restricted and segregated cash 936 936   936 Other investments and assets 338  283 55 338 Financial Liabilities Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims $ 16,641 $  $  $ 14,243 $ 14,243 Investment certificate reserves 13,461   13,420 13,420 Banking and brokerage deposits 23,886 23,886   23,886 Separate account liabilities  investment contracts 3,155  3,155  3,155 Debt and other liabilities 3,769 166 3,610 5 3,781 141 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Restricted and segregated cash includes cash segregated under federal and other regulations held in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of the Companys brokerage customers. Other investments and assets primarily include syndicated loans, credit card receivables, certificate of deposits with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of more than 90 days, the Companys membership in the FHLB and investments related to the Community Reinvestment Act. See Note 7 for additional information on mortgage loans, policy loans, syndicated loans, credit card receivables and deposit receivables. Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims include fixed annuities in deferral status, non-life contingent fixed annuities in payout status, indexed and structured variable annuity host contracts, and the fixed portion of a small number of variable annuity contracts classified as investment contracts. See Note 11 for additional information on these liabilities. Investment certificate reserves represent customer deposits for fixed rate certificates and stock market certificates. Banking and brokerage deposits are amounts payable to customers related to free credit balances, funds deposited by customers and funds accruing to customers as a result of trades or contracts. Separate account liabilities are primarily investment contracts in pooled pension funds offered by Threadneedle. Debt and other liabilities include the Companys long-term debt, short-term borrowings, securities loaned and future funding commitments to affordable housing partnerships and other real estate partnerships. See Note 15 for further information on the Companys long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 17. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities Certain financial instruments and derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys derivative instruments and securities borrowing and lending agreements are subject to master netting and collateral arrangements and qualify for offset. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. Securities borrowed and securities loaned result from transactions between the Companys broker dealer subsidiary and other financial institutions and are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are primarily equity securities. The Companys securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions generally do not have a fixed maturity date and may be terminated by either party under customary terms. The Companys policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 142 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The following tables present the gross and net information about the Companys assets subject to master netting arrangements: December 31, 2023 Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Amounts of Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Net Amount Financial Instruments (1) Cash Collateral Securities Collateral (in millions) Derivatives: OTC $ 5,197 $  $ 5,197 $ ( 3,707 ) $ ( 1,114 ) $ ( 357 ) $ 19 OTC cleared 9  9 ( 9 )    Exchange-traded 39  39 ( 18 )   21 Total derivatives 5,245  5,245 ( 3,734 ) ( 1,114 ) ( 357 ) 40 Securities borrowed 146  146 ( 32 )  ( 111 ) 3 Total $ 5,391 $  $ 5,391 $ ( 3,766 ) $ ( 1,114 ) $ ( 468 ) $ 43 December 31, 2022 Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Amounts of Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Net Amount Financial Instruments (1) Cash Collateral Securities Collateral (in millions) Derivatives: OTC $ 2,900 $  $ 2,900 $ ( 2,322 ) $ ( 568 ) $ ( 5 ) $ 5 OTC cleared 23  23 ( 9 )   14 Exchange-traded 97  97 ( 75 )   22 Total derivatives 3,020  3,020 ( 2,406 ) ( 568 ) ( 5 ) 41 Securities borrowed 199  199 ( 31 )  ( 164 ) 4 Total $ 3,219 $  $ 3,219 $ ( 2,437 ) $ ( 568 ) $ ( 169 ) $ 45 (1) Represents the amount of assets that could be offset by liabilities with the same counterparty under master netting or similar arrangements that management elects not to offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .

In the tables above, the amount of assets or liabilities presented are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements, then any remaining amount is reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral. The actual collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables. When the fair value of collateral accepted by the Company is less than the amount due to the Company, there is a risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform or provide additional collateral. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors collateral values regularly and requires additional collateral when necessary. When the value of collateral pledged by the Company declines, it may be required to post additional collateral. Freestanding derivative instruments are reflected in Other assets and Other liabilities. Cash collateral pledged by the Company is reflected in Other assets and cash collateral accepted by the Company is reflected in Other liabilities. Securities borrowing and lending agreements are reflected in Receivables and Other liabilities, respectively. See Note 18 for additional disclosures related to the Companys derivative instruments and Note 5 for information related to derivatives held by consolidated investment entities. 18. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments enable the Company to manage its exposure to various market risks. The value of such instruments is derived from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including equity, foreign exchange and interest rate indices or prices. The Company primarily enters into derivative agreements for risk management purposes related to the Companys products and operations. Certain of the Companys freestanding derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. The Companys policy on the recognition of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the estimated fair value of the Companys freestanding derivatives after considering the effect of master netting arrangements and collateral. 144 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Generally, the Company uses derivatives as economic hedges and accounting hedges.

See Note 16 for additional information regarding the Companys fair value measurement of derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, investment securities with a fair value of $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, were pledged to meet contractual obligations under derivative contracts, of which $ 145 million and $ 302 million, respectively, may be sold, pledged or rehypothecated by the counterparty. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, investment securities with a fair value of $ 376 million and $ 14 million, respectively, were received as collateral to meet contractual obligations under derivative contracts, of which $ 314 million and $ 5 million, respectively, may be sold, pledged or rehypothecated by the Company. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had sold, pledged or rehypothecated none of these securities. In addition, as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts and was not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. 145 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

These derivative instruments are used as economic hedges of equity, interest rate, credit and foreign currency exchange rate risk related to various products and transactions of the Company. The deferred premium associated with certain of the above options is paid or received semi-annually over the life of the contract or at maturity. The following is a summary of the payments the Company is scheduled to make and receive for these options as of December 31, 2023: Premiums Payable Premiums Receivable (in millions) 2024 $ 131 $ 23 2025 121 20 2026 247 88 2027 20  2028 30  2029-2030 378  Total $ 927 $ 131 Actual timing and payment amounts may differ due to future settlements, modifications or exercises of the contracts prior to the full premium being paid or received. Structured variable annuity, IUL and stock market certificate products have returns tied to the performance of equity markets. As a result of fluctuations in equity markets, the obligation incurred by the Company related to structured variable annuity, IUL and stock market certificate products will positively or negatively impact earnings over the life of these products. The equity components of structured variable annuity, IUL and stock market certificate product obligations are considered embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from their host contracts for valuation purposes and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. As a means of economically hedging its obligations under the provisions of these products, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, index options and futures contracts. As discussed in Note 13, the Company issues variable annuity contracts that provide protection to contractholders from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. The Company economically hedges its obligations under these market risk benefits using options, swaptions, swaps and futures. The Company enters into futures, credit default swaps, commodity swaps, total return swaps and foreign currency forwards to manage its exposure to price risk arising from seed money investments in proprietary investment products. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge its exposure to certain foreign transactions. The Company enters into futures 147 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) contracts, total return swaps and foreign currency forwards to economically hedge its exposure related to compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate swaps to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments. Cash Flow Hedges The Company has designated derivative instruments as a cash flow hedge for equity exposure of certain compensation-related liabilities and interest rate exposure on forecasted debt interest payments. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the gains or losses on the derivative instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented within the same line item as the earnings impact of the hedged item in Interest and debt expense. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings related to cash flow hedges were immaterial. The estimated net amount recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2023 that the Company expects to reclassify to earnings as a reduction to Interest and debt expense within the next twelve months is $ 0.8 million. Currently, the longest period of time over which the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 12 years and relates to forecasted debt interest payments. See Note 21 for a rollforward of net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives included in AOCI related to cash flow hedges. Net Investment Hedges The Company entered into, and designated as net investment hedges in foreign operations, forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Companys foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its investment in Threadneedle. As the Company determined that the forward contracts are effective, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recognized a loss of $ 3 million, a gain of $ 15 million and a loss of $ 1 million, respectively, in OCI. Credit Risk Credit risk associated with the Companys derivatives is the risk that a derivative counterparty will not perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable derivative contract. To mitigate such risk, the Company has established guidelines and oversight of credit risk through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. Key components of this program are to require preapproval of counterparties and the use of master netting and collateral arrangements whenever practical. See Note 17 for additional information on the Companys credit exposure related to derivative assets. Certain of the Companys derivative contracts contain provisions that adjust the level of collateral the Company is required to post based on the Companys debt rating (or based on the financial strength of the Companys life insurance subsidiaries for contracts in which those subsidiaries are the counterparty). Additionally, certain of the Companys derivative contracts contain provisions that allow the counterparty to terminate the contract if the Companys debt does not maintain a specific credit rating (generally an investment grade rating) or the Companys life insurance subsidiaries do not maintain a specific financial strength rating. If these termination provisions were to be triggered, the Companys counterparty could require immediate settlement of any net liability position. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate fair value of derivative contracts in a net liability position containing such credit contingent provisions was $ 65 million and $ 240 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral for such instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 58 million and $ 236 million, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation The Companys share-based compensation plans consist of the Amended and Restated Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2005 ICP), the Ameriprise Financial Franchise Advisor Deferred Compensation Plan and the Ameriprise Advisor Group Deferred Compensation Plan. 149 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The components of the Companys share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Stock option $ 16 $ 16 $ 20 Restricted stock 27 27 24 Restricted stock units and deferred share units 144 127 108 Liability awards 62 44 92 Total $ 249 $ 214 $ 244 For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total income tax benefit using the statutory rate related to share-based compensation expense was $ 52 million, $ 45 million and $ 51 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $ 184 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards under the Companys share-based compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. Amended and Restated Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan The 2005 ICP, as amended and restated, was approved by shareholders on April 26, 2023, and provides for the grant of cash and equity incentive awards to directors, employees and independent contractors, including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and similar awards designed to comply with the applicable federal regulations and laws of jurisdiction. Under the 2005 ICP, as amended and restated a maximum of 58.1 million shares may be issued. Of this total, no more than 5.0 million shares may be issued after December 31, 2022 for full value awards, which are awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights. Shares issued under the 2005 ICP may be authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. Ameriprise Financial 2008 Employment Incentive Equity Award Plan Effective February 23, 2023, the Ameriprise Financial 2008 Employment Incentive Equity Award Plan (the 2008 Plan), which was designed to grant equity incentive awards to new employees in compliance with applicable federal and foreign regulations, was terminated by the Company. At the time of termination, there were no unvested or unexercised awards outstanding under the 2008 Plan and, as a result of the termination of the plan, no future shares could be granted under the 2008 Plan. Stock Options Stock options granted under the 2005 ICP have an exercise price not less than 100 % of the current fair market value of a share of the Companys common stock on the grant date and a maximum term of 10 years. Stock options granted generally vest ratably over three to four years . Vesting of option awards may be accelerated based on age and length of service. Stock options granted are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the options is calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock option grants: 2023 2022 2021 Dividend yield 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.5 % Expected volatility 33 % 35 % 36 % Risk-free interest rate 3.6 % 1.7 % 0.4 % Expected life of stock option (years) 5.0 5.0 5.0 The dividend yield assumption represents the Companys expected dividend yield based on its historical dividend payouts and managements expectations. The expected volatility is based on the Companys historical and implied volatilities. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected option life is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the grant date. The expected life of the option is based on the Companys past experience and other considerations. The weighted average grant date fair value for options granted during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 99.86 , $ 80.48 and $ 48.48 , respectively. 150 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) A summary of the Companys stock option activity for 2023 is presented below (shares and intrinsic value in millions): Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at January 1 2.8 $ 160.57 5.8 $ 419 Granted 0.2 344.45 Exercised ( 0.7 ) 144.68 Outstanding at December 31 2.3 177.60 5.4 457 Exercisable at December 31 1.9 154.98 4.8 422 The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 136 million, $ 130 million and $ 219 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards granted under the 2005 ICP generally vest ratably over three to four years or at the end of five years . Compensation expense for restricted stock awards is based on the market price of Ameriprise Financial common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Quarterly dividends are paid on restricted stock, as declared by the Companys Board of Directors, during the vesting period and are not subject to forfeiture. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Share Units The 2005 ICP provides for the grant of deferred share units to non-employee directors of the Company and the 2005 ICP Plan provide for the grant of restricted stock units or deferred share units to employees. The director awards are fully vested upon issuance and are settled for Ameriprise Financial common stock upon the directors termination of service. The employee awards generally vest ratably over three to four years . Compensation expense for deferred share units and restricted stock units is based on the market price of Ameriprise Financial stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or on an accelerated basis if certain age and length of service requirements are met. Deferred share units granted to non-employee directors are expensed immediately. Dividends are paid on restricted stock units, as declared by the Companys Board of Directors, during the vesting period and are not subject to forfeiture. Dividend equivalents are issued on deferred share units, as dividends are declared by the Company's Board of Directors, and are not paid until distribution of the award. Dividend equivalents on the director awards are not subject to forfeiture, but on employee awards they are forfeited if the award is forfeited. Ameriprise Financial Deferred Compensation Plan The Ameriprise Financial Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) under the 2005 ICP gives certain employees the choice to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, which can be invested in investment options as provided by the DCP, including the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund. The DCP is an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company provides a match on certain deferrals. Participant deferrals vest immediately and the Company match vests after three years . Distributions are made in shares of the Companys common stock for the portion of the deferral invested in the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund and the Company match, for which the Company has recorded in equity. The DCP does allow for accelerated vesting of the share-based awards in cases of death, disability and qualified retirement. Compensation expense related to the Company match is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or on an accelerated basis if certain age and length of service requirements are met. Dividend equivalents are issued on deferrals into the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund and the Company match. Dividend equivalents related to deferrals are not subject to forfeiture, whereas dividend equivalents related to the Company match are subject to forfeiture until fully vested. Ameriprise Financial Franchise Advisor Deferred Compensation Plan The Franchise Advisor Deferred Compensation Plan (the AFG Deferral Plan) is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to certain advisors and leaders associated with the Company. The AFG Deferral Plan has not been approved by the Companys shareholders, and it is a value-neutral plan (as that term is used by proxy advisory firms) and there will be no additional premium or matching contributions. Under the AFG Deferral Plan, a maximum of 12.5 million Company shares may be issued. The AFG Deferral Plan allows participants to voluntarily defer a portion of their cash commissions and elect crediting rate alternatives that includes a fund based on Ameriprise Financial stock or other investment options in lieu of receiving the applicable cash compensation. Amounts a participant chooses to invest in the fund tracking Ameriprise Financial stock will be settled in Ameriprise shares; all voluntary deferrals invested in other investment options will be settled in cash. From 2006-2010, the Company provided advisors with a matching contribution with respect to these voluntary deferred amounts; however, the Company has not provided a match since 2010 and has amended the AFG Deferral Plan to remove any matching contributions. There are approximately 113,000 151 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) shares outstanding under this prior matching contribution. Other than this historical matching contribution, the Company does not provide any additional premium in connection with the deferred compensation. In addition to the voluntary deferral of cash commissions, certain participants are eligible to earn amounts in recognition of certain performance achievements that vest ratably over three or four years . When earned, award amounts are credited to a participants account and receive a crediting rate based on Ameriprise Financial stock, and a participant elects (when an award is granted) whether to receive payout of these awards in cash or stock. The Company does not provide any additional premium or matching contribution in connection with the deferred compensation. Share units receive dividend equivalents, as dividends are declared by the Companys Board of Directors, until distribution and are subject to forfeiture until vested. Ameriprise Advisor Group Deferred Compensation Plan The Advisor Group Deferred Compensation Plan (the AAG Deferral Plan) was established in 2009 as an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to certain employee advisors and field leaders of the Company. The AAG Deferral Plan was not approved by the Companys shareholders and is considered a value-neutral plan (as that term is used by proxy advisory firms) and there will be no additional premium or matching contributions. Under the AAG Deferral Plan, a maximum of 3.0 million Company shares may be issued. The AAG Deferral Plan allows eligible employees to voluntarily defer a portion of their base salary, bonus and/or commissions and elect crediting rate alternatives that include a fund based on Ameriprise Financial stock or other investment options in lieu of receiving the applicable cash compensation. Such deferrals are fully vested and not subject to future service requirements or forfeitures and the Company does not provide any additional premium or matching contribution in connection with the deferred compensation. Amounts a participant chooses to invest in the fund tracking Ameriprise Financial stock will be settled in Ameriprise shares; all voluntary deferrals invested in other investment options will be settled in cash. In addition to the voluntary deferral component, participants may earn amounts in recognition of certain performance achievements. These amounts receive a crediting rate based on Ameriprise Financial stock or other investment options, at the participants election where applicable. For amounts allocated in the fund that tracks the performance of Ameriprise Financial stock, a participant elects (when an award is granted) whether to receive payout of these awards in cash or Company shares. For amounts allocated to other options, the participant receives payout in cash. These award types are subject to future service requirements and forfeitures, and the Company does not provide any additional premium or matching contribution in connection with the deferred compensation. Share units receive dividend equivalents, as dividends are declared by the Companys Board of Directors, until distribution and are subject to forfeiture until vested. BMO Share Plans As part of the acquisition of the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business in 2021, the Company maintains certain legacy BMO Financial Group share-based awards that were granted prior to the acquisition. All relevant awards are cash settled with the last vesting date in 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the liability related to these awards was $ 1 million and $ 26 million, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities.

The weighted average grant date fair value for franchise advisor and advisor group deferrals during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 336.62 , $ 280.49 and $ 241.34 , respectively. 152 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Performance Share Units Under the 2005 ICP, the Companys Executive Leadership Team may be awarded a target number of performance share units (PSUs). PSUs will be earned only to the extent that the Company attains certain goals relating to the Companys performance and relative total shareholder returns against peers over a three-year period. The awards also have a three-year service condition with cliff vesting with an accelerated service condition based on age and length of service. The actual number of PSUs ultimately earned could vary from zero , if performance goals are not met, to as much as 200 % of the target for awards made prior to 2018 and 175 % of the target for awards made in 2018 or later, if performance goals are significantly exceeded. The value of each target PSU is equal to the value of one share of Ameriprise Financial common stock. The total number of target PSUs outstanding at the end of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 0.2 million, 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The PSUs are liability awards.

Regulatory Requirements Restrictions on the transfer of funds exist under regulatory requirements applicable to certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries. Insurance subsidiaries The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) defines Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements for insurance companies. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. These requirements apply to the Companys life insurance companies. The Companys life insurance companies each met their respective minimum RBC requirements. The Companys life insurance companies are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of their respective states of domicile, which vary materially from GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The more significant differences from GAAP include charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing annuity and insurance reserves using different actuarial methods and assumptions, valuing investments on a different basis and excluding certain assets from the balance sheet by charging them directly to surplus, such as a portion of the net deferred income tax assets. State insurance statutes contain limitations as to the amount of dividends that insurers may make without providing prior notification to state regulators. For RiverSource Life, payments in excess of unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the State of Minnesota, require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, RiverSource Lifes primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. RiverSource Lifes statutory unassigned deficit was $ 582 million and $ 679 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, dividends whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, exceed the greater of the previous years statutory net gain from operations or 10 % of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as extraordinary dividends. Extraordinary dividends also require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and are subject to potential disapproval. Statutory capital and surplus for RiverSource Life was $ 3.1 billion as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Statutory net gain from operations and net income are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) RiverSource Life Statutory net gain from operations $ 1,331 $ 1,615 $ 1,366 Statutory net income 845 1,769 253 Government debt securities of $ 4 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022 held by the Companys life insurance subsidiaries were on deposit with various states as required by law. 156 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Broker-dealer subsidiaries The Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an alternative net capital requirement which AEIS and Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (AFS) (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $ 250 thousand or 2 % of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements. The following table presents the net capital position of both AEIS and AFS: December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions, except percentages) AEIS Net capital as a percent of aggregate debit items 11.62 % 15.76 % Net capital $ 171 $ 208 Less: required net capital 29 26 Excess net capital $ 142 $ 182 AFS Net capital $ 101 $ 90 Less: required net capital   Excess net capital $ 101 $ 90 On February 14, 2024, AEIS and AFS paid cash dividends of $ 40 million and $ 20 million, respectively, to AMPF Holding, LLC. These dividends were declared subsequent to the balance sheet date. Bank subsidiary The Company is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to various banking regulations. However, the Company is not currently subject to the risk-based capital requirements of the Federal Reserve Bank because it is substantially engaged in insurance activities. Ameriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (CEIT) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Banks internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, the Company has elected to exclude AOCI from its calculation of regulatory capital. Ameriprise Banks requirements to maintain adequate capital ratios in relation to its risk-weighted asset levels could affect its ability to take capital actions, such as the payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2023, Ameriprise Banks capital levels exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirement and was categorized as well-capitalized. 157 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) To meet requirements for capital adequacy purposes or to be categorized as well-capitalized,Ameriprise Bank must maintain minimum CEIT, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage amounts and ratios as set forth in the following table: Regulatory Capital Actual Requirement for capital adequacy purposes To be well capitalized under regulatory provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (in millions, except percentages) At December 31, 2023 Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 1,715 31.72 % $ 243 4.50 % $ 351 6.50 % Tier 1 capital 1,715 31.72 324 6.00 433 8.00 Total capital 1,724 31.89 433 8.00 541 10.00 Tier 1 leverage 1,715 7.44 922 4.00 1,153 5.00 At December 31, 2022 Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 1,542 30.18 % $ 230 4.50 % $ 332 6.50 % Tier 1 capital 1,542 30.18 307 6.00 409 8.00 Total capital 1,546 30.26 409 8.00 511 10.00 Tier 1 leverage 1,542 7.72 799 4.00 999 5.00 Other subsidiaries Ameriprise Certificate Company (ACC) is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota and understandings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets. Under the provisions of its certificates and the 1940 Act, ACC was required to have qualified assets (as that term is defined in Section 28(b) of the 1940 Act) in the amount of $ 13.5 billion and $ 9.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. ACC had qualified assets of $ 14.3 billion and $ 9.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ameriprise Trust Company is subject to capital adequacy requirements under the laws of the State of Minnesota as enforced by the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Required capital for Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for investment firms. 24. Income Taxes The components of income tax provision attributable to continuing operations were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Current income tax Federal $ 518 $ 509 $ 551 State and local 124 93 79 Foreign 18 25 47 Total current income tax 660 627 677 Deferred income tax Federal 45 155 113 State and local ( 14 ) 6  Foreign ( 13 ) ( 6 ) ( 22 ) Total deferred income tax 18 155 91 Total income tax provision $ 678 $ 782 $ 768 158 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The geographic sources of pretax income from continuing operations were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) United States $ 3,199 $ 3,824 $ 3,961 Foreign 35 107 224 Total $ 3,234 $ 3,931 $ 4,185 The principal reasons that the aggregate income tax provision attributable to continuing operations is different from that computed by using the U.S. statutory rate of 21% were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Tax at U.S. statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Changes in taxes resulting from: State taxes, net of federal benefit 2.7 2.0 1.5 Non-deductible expenses 1.1 0.5 0.4 Incentive compensation ( 1.5 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 1.3 ) Low income housing tax credits ( 1.0 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 1.6 ) Other, net ( 1.3 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 1.7 ) Income tax provision 21.0 % 19.9 % 18.3 % The increase in the Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 is primarily the result of an increase in state taxes, net of federal benefit, partially offset by incentive compensation and various other adjustments. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily the result of a decrease in low income housing tax credits and an increase in state taxes, net of federal benefit, and various other adjustments. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for GAAP reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the statutory rate of 21 % as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The significant components of the Companys deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included net within Other assets or Other liabilities, were as follows: December 31, 2023 2022 (1) (in millions) Deferred income tax assets Insurance and annuity benefits including corresponding hedges $ 1,244 $ 1,404 Deferred compensation including corresponding hedges 545 480 Investments including net unrealized on Available-for-Sale securities 335 512 Net operating loss 74 63 Other 127 134 Gross deferred income tax assets 2,325 2,593 Less: valuation allowance 65 65 Total deferred income tax assets 2,260 2,528 Deferred income tax liabilities Deferred acquisition costs 390 420 Goodwill and intangibles 313 301 Other 131 158 Gross deferred income tax liabilities 834 879 Net deferred income tax assets $ 1,426 $ 1,649 (1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation and primarily relate to derivative activity being presented with the liabilities they are hedging and remaining investments being presented together inclusive of net unrealized on Available-for-Sale securities. 159 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Included in the Companys deferred income tax assets are tax benefits related to state net operating losses of $ 30 million, net of federal benefit, which will expire beginning December 31, 2024 and foreign net operating losses of $ 44 million, which do not expire. Based on analysis of the Companys tax position as of December 31, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize certain state net operating losses of $ 29 million and state deferred tax assets of $ 2 million, net of federal benefit, and foreign net operating losses of $ 34 million; therefore, a valuation allowance of $ 65 million has been established. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at January 1 $ 138 $ 125 $ 110 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 26 12 21 Reductions for tax positions related to the current year ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Additions for tax positions of prior years 80 5 5 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 85 ) ( 1 ) ( 8 ) Reductions due to lapse of statutes of limitations ( 5 )  ( 1 ) Audit settlements ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Balance at December 31 $ 150 $ 138 $ 125 If recognized, approximately $ 120 million, $ 106 million and $ 95 million, net of federal tax benefits, of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months. The Company estimates that the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $ 25 million in the next 12 months primarily due to expected exam closures and state statutes of limitations expirations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. The Company recognized a net increase of $ 12 million, $ 4 million and nil in interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a payable of $ 26 million and $ 14 million, respectively, related to accrued interest and penalties. The Company or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, the federal statutes of limitations are closed on years through 2018. A previously open item for 2014 and 2015 was resolved in the second quarter of 2023. Also in the second quarter of 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for tax years 2016 through 2018 was finalized. The IRS is currently auditing the Companys U.S. income tax returns for 2019 and 2020. The Companys state income tax returns are currently under examination by various jurisdictions for years ranging from 2017 through 2021. The Company is an applicable corporation required to compute CAMT; however, based on current estimates the Company does not expect to be liable for the CAMT in 2023 and therefore a liability has not been recorded. 25. Retirement Plans and Profit Sharing Arrangements Defined Benefit Plans Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits The Companys U.S. non-advisor employees who were hired prior to April of 2019 are generally eligible for the Ameriprise Financial Retirement Plan (the Retirement Plan), a noncontributory defined benefit plan which is a qualified plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). However, effective April 2020, the Company no longer enrolls new employees in the Retirement Plan. Funding of costs for the Retirement Plan complies with the applicable minimum funding requirements specified by ERISA and is held in a trust. The Retirement Plan is a cash balance plan by which the employees accrued benefits are based on notional account balances, which are maintained for each individual. Each pay period these balances are credited with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible compensation as defined by the Retirement Plan (which includes, but is not limited to, base pay, performance based incentive pay, commissions, shift differential and overtime). The percentage ranges from 2.5 % to 10 % depending on several factors including years of service as of April 2020 and will no longer increase with more years of service. Employees balances are also credited with a fixed rate of interest that is updated each January 1 and is based on the average of the daily five-year U.S. Treasury Note yields for the previous October 1 through November 30, with a minimum crediting rate of 5 % and maximum crediting rate of 10 %. Employees are fully vested after 3 years of service or upon retirement at or after age 65, disability or death while employed. Employees have the option to receive annuity payments or a lump sum payout of vested balance after termination or retirement. In addition, the Company sponsors the Ameriprise Financial Supplemental Retirement Plan (the SRP), an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan is for certain highly compensated 160 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) employees to replace the benefit that cannot be provided by the Retirement Plan due to IRS limits. The SRP generally parallels the Retirement Plan but offers different payment options. The Company also sponsors unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance to retired U.S. employees. On December 31, 2016, the access to retiree health care coverage was closed to all active employees who had previously met the qualification requirements. Instead, only existing retirees, as of January 1, 2017, qualifying for the plan and electing coverage will be provided a fixed amount to subsidize health care insurance purchased through other providers. Net periodic postretirement benefit costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. All plans are closed to new participants. The plans provide benefits calculated using salary data of the participants. The plans are based on final salary payments and benefits are adjusted in line with plan rules (e.g. in line with price inflation in the U.K.) once in payment during retirement. The level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and pensionable salary at retirement date or date of termination if earlier. All components of the net periodic benefit cost are recorded in General and administrative expense and were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Service cost $ 29 $ 43 $ 45 Interest cost 65 39 21 Expected return on plan assets ( 76 ) ( 70 ) ( 57 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Amortization of net loss  18 23 Other 3 3 5 Net periodic benefit cost $ 20 $ 32 $ 35 The prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active participants. The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the benefit obligation: Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Benefit obligation at January 1 $ 1,256 $ 1,815 $ 11 $ 13 Service cost 29 43   Interest cost 65 39 1  Benefits paid ( 23 ) ( 21 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Actuarial (gain) loss 52 ( 520 )  ( 1 ) Settlements ( 45 ) ( 27 )   Foreign currency rate changes 21 ( 73 )   Benefit obligation at December 31 $ 1,355 $ 1,256 $ 11 $ 11 The actuarial (gain) loss for pension plans were primarily due to changes in the discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 161 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

The Company also considered historical returns on the plans assets. Discount rates are based on yields available on high-quality corporate bonds that would generate cash flows necessary to pay the benefits when due. 162 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) The Companys pension plans assets are invested in an aggregate diversified portfolio to minimize the impact of any adverse or unexpected results from a security class on the entire portfolio. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by asset type, performance and risk characteristics and number of investments. When appropriate and consistent with the objectives of the plans, derivative instruments may be used to mitigate risk or provide further diversification, subject to the investment policies of the plans. Asset classes and ranges considered appropriate for investment of the plans assets are determined by each plans investment committee. The target allocations are 70 % equity securities, 20 % debt securities and 10 % all other types of investments, except for the assets in pooled pension funds and certain collective funds described below, and additional voluntary contribution assets outside the U.S. which are allocated at the discretion of the individual and will be converted at retirement into the defined benefit pension plan. Actual allocations will generally be within 5 % of these targets. In addition, assets in pooled pension funds and certain collective funds reflect allocations between growth and liability matching portfolios and may shift based on manager discretion. These funds invest primarily in debt securities, equity securities, and certain derivatives, either directly or through other collective funds. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant holdings of any single issuer and the exposure to derivative instruments was not significant. The following tables present the Companys pension plans assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Asset Category December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Equity securities: U.S. small cap stocks $ 90 $ 7 $  $ 97 Registered investment companies 90   90 Insurance contracts   23 23 Cash equivalents at NAV 3 (1) Collective investment funds at NAV 859 (1) Real estate investment trusts at NAV 28 (1) Hedge funds at NAV 24 (1) Pooled pension funds at NAV 168 (1) Total $ 180 $ 7 $ 23 $ 1,292 December 31, 2022 Asset Category Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in millions) Equity securities: U.S. small cap stocks $ 76 $ 6 $  $ 82 Registered investment companies 80   80 Insurance contracts   19 19 Cash equivalents at NAV 6 (1) Collective investment funds at NAV 758 (1) Real estate investment trusts at NAV 29 (1) Hedge funds at NAV 16 (1) Pooled pension funds at NAV 152 (1) Total $ 156 $ 6 $ 19 $ 1,142 (1) Amounts are comprised of certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities are managed to track the performance of common market indices for both U.S. and non-U.S. securities, primarily across large cap, small cap and emerging market asset classes. Cash equivalents consist of holdings in a money market fund that seeks to equal the return of the three month U.S. Treasury bill. Collective investment funds include equity and debt securities. Real estate funds are managed to track the performance of a broad population of investment grade non-agricultural income producing properties. The Companys investments in hedge funds include investments in a multi-strategy fund and an off-shore fund managed to track the performance of broad fund of fund indices. Pooled pension funds are managed to track a specific benchmark based on the investment objectives of the fund. The fair value of equity securities classified as Level 1 use quoted prices in active markets and the fair value of equity securities classified as Level 2 is determined based on a market approach using observable inputs. The fair value of the registered investment companies mutual funds is determined by the NAV which represents the exit price. These funds are classified as Level 1 as they are 163 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) traded in active markets and quoted prices are available. Insurance contracts support certain non-U.S plans and are classified as Level 3. The amounts recognized in AOCI, net of tax, as of December 31, 2023 but not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost included an unrecognized actuarial loss of $ 63 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $ 1 million related to the Companys pension plans. The Companys other postretirement plans included an unrecognized actuarial gain of $ 2 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of nil as of December 31, 2023. See Note 21 for a rollforward of AOCI related to the Companys defined benefit plans. The Companys pension plans expect to make benefit payments to retirees as follows: Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans (in millions) 2024 $ 74 $ 1 2025 85 1 2026 82 1 2027 87 1 2028 92 1 2029-2033 500 4 The Company expects to contribute $ 39 million and nil to its pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively, in 2024. Defined Contribution Plans The Companys U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in the Ameriprise Financial 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to make contributions through payroll deductions up to IRS limits and invest their contributions in one or more of the 401(k) Plan investment options, which include the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund. The Company provides a dollar for dollar match up to the first 5 % of eligible compensation an employee contributes on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) basis for each annual period. Effective April 2020, employees not eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan will receive a 2 % company contribution to their 401(k) Plan once they become eligible for contributions. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees become eligible for contributions under the plan during the pay period they reach 60 days of service. Match contributions are fully vested after five years of service, vesting ratably over the first five years of service, or upon retirement at or after age 65, disability or death while employed. The Companys defined contribution plan expense was $ 67 million, $ 67 million and $ 59 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Employees outside the U.S. who are not covered by the 401(k) may be covered by local defined contribution plans which are subject to applicable laws and rules of the country where the plan is administered. The Companys expense related to defined contribution plans outside the U.S. was $ 16 million, $ 8 million and $ 8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 26. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments The following table presents the Companys funding commitments as of December 31: 2023 2022 (in millions) Commercial mortgage loans $ 17 $ 1 Property funds 27 26 Pledged asset lines of credit 1,864 1,448 Total funding commitments $ 1,908 $ 1,475 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in legal proceedings which include regulatory inquiries, arbitration and litigation, including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its activities as a diversified financial services firm. These include proceedings specific to the Company as well as proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which it operates. The Company can also be subject to legal proceedings arising out of its general business activities, such as its investments, contracts, leases and employment relationships. Uncertain economic conditions, heightened and sustained volatility in the financial markets and significant financial reform legislation may increase the likelihood that clients and other persons or regulators may present or threaten legal claims or that regulators increase the scope or frequency of examinations of the Company or the financial services industry generally. 164 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As with other financial services firms, the level of regulatory activity and inquiry concerning the Companys businesses remains elevated. From time to time, the Company receives requests for information from, and/or has been subject to examination or claims by, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the OCC, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the Federal Reserve Board, state insurance and securities regulators, state attorneys general and various other domestic and foreign governmental and quasi-governmental authorities on behalf of themselves or clients concerning the Companys business activities and practices, and the practices of the Companys financial advisors. The Company typically has numerous pending matters which include information requests, exams or inquiries regarding certain subjects, including from time to time: sales and distribution of, and disclosure practices related to, mutual and other pooled funds, exchange traded funds, private funds, segregated accounts, annuities, equity and fixed income securities, real estate investment trusts, insurance products, banking products and financial advice offerings, including managed accounts; wholesaler activity; supervision of the Companys financial advisors and other associated persons; administration of insurance and annuity claims; security of client information; trading activity and the Companys monitoring and supervision of such activity; recordkeeping requirements; and transaction monitoring systems and controls. The Company is cooperating with the applicable regulators. In connection with one such matter, the Company has responded to SEC document and information requests regarding the preservation of certain business-related communications sent on electronic messaging platforms that have not been approved by the Company. During 2023, the Company recorded a $ 50 million accrual for this matter within our introducing broker dealer subsidiary. The Company has reached an agreement in principle with the Staff, subject to Commission approval, that it believes resolves this matter. These pending matters are subject to uncertainties and, as such, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible, or to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss that may result from such matters. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when any such proceedings will be initiated or resolved. Matters frequently need to be more developed before a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any matter. An adverse outcome in any matter could result in an adverse judgment, a settlement, fine, penalty, or other sanction, and may lead to further claims, examinations, or adverse publicity each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company establishes an accrued liability for contingent litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses the nature of the contingency when management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that the outcome may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. In such cases, there still may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts reasonably estimated and accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability, but continues to monitor, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling a matter, further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Once the Company establishes an accrued liability with respect to a loss contingency, the Company continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established, and any appropriate adjustments are made each quarter. Guaranty Fund Assessments RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY are required by law to be a member of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, the Company could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. The Company projects its cost of future guaranty fund assessments based on estimates of insurance company insolvencies provided by the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations and the amount of its premiums written relative to the industry-wide premium in each state. The Company accrues the estimated cost of future guaranty fund assessments when it is considered probable that an assessment will be imposed, the event obligating the Company to pay the assessment has occurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. The Company has a liability for estimated guaranty fund assessments and a related premium tax asset. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated liability was $ 34 million and $ 12 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related premium tax asset was $ 29 million and $ 10 million, respectively. The expected period over which guaranty fund assessments will be made and the related tax credits recovered is not known. 27. Related Party Transactions The Company may engage in transactions in the ordinary course of business with significant shareholders or their subsidiaries, between the Company and its directors and officers or with other companies whose directors or officers may also serve as directors or officers for the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company carries out these transactions on customary terms. The Companys executive officers and directors may have transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries involving financial products and insurance services. All obligations arising from these transactions are in the ordinary course of the Companys business and are on the same terms in effect for comparable transactions with the general public. Such obligations involve normal risks of collection and do not have features or terms that are unfavorable to the Company or its subsidiaries. 165 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) These transactions have not had a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 28. Segment Information The Companys four reporting segments are Advice & Wealth Management, Asset Management, Retirement & Protection Solutions and Corporate & Other. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for operating adjustments defined below, the method of capital allocation, the accounting for gains (losses) from intercompany revenues and expenses and not providing for income taxes on a segment basis. The largest source of intersegment revenues and expenses is retail distribution services, where segments are charged transfer pricing rates that approximate arms length market prices for distribution through the Advice & Wealth Management segment. The Advice & Wealth Management segment provides distribution services for affiliated and non-affiliated products and services. The Asset Management segment provides investment management services for the Companys owned assets and client assets, and accordingly charges investment and advisory management fees to the other segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in the Companys consolidated results. All costs related to shared services are allocated to the segments based on a rate times volume or fixed basis. The Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through the Companys advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between the Companys advisors and its clients and focus on helping clients achieve their financial goals. The Companys advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals. A significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. The Company also earns net investment income on owned assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing the Companys affiliated products and services provided to its retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment. The Asset Management segment provides investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through the Columbia Threadneedle Investments  brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (Columbia Management) and Threadneedle, including the BMO Global Asset Management (EMEA) business acquired in 2021. Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. Additional subsidiaries beyond Columbia Management and Threadneedle are also included in our Asset Management segment. The Company offers U.S. retail clients with a range of products through both unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and the Advice & Wealth Management segment. The Company provides institutional products and services through its institutional sales force. Retail products for non-U.S. investors are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Retail products include U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies, collective funds and property and infrastructure funds. CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. The Company may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. The Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by the Advice & Wealth Management and Retirement & Protection Solutions segments. The Retirement & Protection Solutions segment includes Retirement Solutions (variable annuities and payout annuities) and Protection Solutions (life and disability income insurance). Retirement Solutions provides variable annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. The Company provides variable annuity products through its advisors. Revenues for the Companys variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. The Company also earns net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for non-life contingent payout annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Revenues for the Companys life contingent payout annuities are earned as premium revenue. Protection Solutions offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of the Companys retail clients including life and DI insurance. Life and DI products are primarily provided through the Companys advisors. The Company issues insurance policies through its RiverSource Life companies. The primary sources of revenues for Protection Solutions are premiums, fees and charges that the Company receives to assume insurance-related risk. The Company earns net investment income on owned assets supporting 166 Index Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. The Company also receives fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies separate account assets supporting VUL investment options. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds under variable annuity contracts and VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by the Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment. The Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in the Companys subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes the results of the Companys closed blocks of long term care insurance and fixed annuity and fixed indexed annuity business. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of consolidated investment entities, which are excluded on an operating basis. Revenues for the Companys fixed deferred annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on the RiverSource Life companies general account assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. Management uses segment adjusted operating measures in goal setting, as a basis for determining employee compensation and in evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, adjusted operating earnings is the Companys measure of segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. The Company believes the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its business by reflecting the underlying performance of its core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. Management excludes mean reversion related impacts from the Companys adjusted operating measures. The mean reversion related impact is defined as the impact on VUL products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves. Effective in the third quarter of 2021, management has excluded the impacts of block transfer reinsurance transactions from the adjusted operating measures. Adjusted operating earnings is defined as adjusted operating net revenues less adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating net revenues and adjusted operating expenses exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of reinsurance accrual); the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on VUL products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs. The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of the RiverSource Life companies nonperformance spread. Concurrent with the adoption of ASU 2018-12, management no longer excludes adjustments for DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue amortization. Amortization of DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue for long-duration contracts are no longer impacted by markets and are now amortized on a constant-level basis.

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

d Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported in the Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in and pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. It should be noted that, because of inherent limitations, our Companys disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of December 31, 2023. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2023, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

Schedule I  Condensed Financial Information of Registrant Notes to Condensed Financial Information of Registrant (Parent Company Only) 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying Condensed Financial Statements include the accounts of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Parent Company) and, on an equity basis, its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The financial information of the Parent Company should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Ameriprise Financial). Parent Company revenues and expenses, other than interest and debt expense, are primarily related to intercompany transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates. In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to long-duration insurance contracts (ASU 2018-12). When our insurance subsidiaries adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023 with a transition date of January 1, 2021 (the transition date), opening equity was adjusted for the adoption impacts to retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and prior periods were restated. The adoption impact as of January 1, 2021 was a reduction in total equity of $ 1.9 billion, of which $ 0.9 billion and $ 1.0 billion were reflected in retained earnings and AOCI, respectively. 2. Investments On December 23, 2020, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life) issued a $ 500 million unsecured 3.5 % surplus note due December 31, 2050 to the Parent Company. The surplus note is subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in full of RiverSource Lifes obligations to policyholders, claimants and beneficiaries and all other creditors. No payment of principal or interest shall be made without the prior approval of the Minnesota Department of Commerce and such payments shall be made only from RiverSource Lifes statutory surplus. Interest payments, which commenced on June 30, 2021, are due semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31. Subject to the preceding conditions, RiverSource Life may prepay all or a portion of the principal at any time. The held-to-maturity investment was $ 500 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022 and is recorded in Investments on the Parent Companys Condensed Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, interest income was $ 18 million, $ 18 million and $ 17 million, respectively, and is reported in Net investment income on the Parent Companys Condensed Statements of Operations. The Parent Company invested in the residual tranche of an asset backed security structure issued by Ameriprise Advisor Financing, LLC (AAF) and in the residual tranche of an asset backed security structure issued by Ameriprise Advisor Financing 2, LLC (AAF 2), both subsidiaries of the Parent Company. The asset backed securities are collateralized by a portfolio of loans issued to advisors affiliated with Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (AFS), a subsidiary of the Parent Company. During the third quarter of 2022, the Parent Company redeemed the outstanding residual tranche issued by AAF, realizing a $ 23 million loss, and invested $ 30 million in a new residual tranche issued by AAF 2. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the residual tranche issued by AAF 2 was $ 30 million and $ 27 million, respectively. The fair value of the residual tranche is reported in Investments on the Parent Companys Condensed Balance Sheets.
