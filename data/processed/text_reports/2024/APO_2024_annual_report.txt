Apollo funds, our funds and references to the funds we manage The funds (including the parallel funds and alternative investment vehicles of such funds), partnerships, accounts, including strategic investment accounts or SIAs, alternative asset companies and other entities for which subsidiaries of Apollo provide investment management or advisory services. Apollo Operating Group (i) The entities through which we currently operate our asset management business and (ii) one or more entities formed for the purpose of, among other activities, holding certain of our gains or losses on our principal investments in the funds, which we refer to as our principal investments. APSG I Apollo Strategic Growth Capital APSG II Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II ARI Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. Assets Under Management, or AUM The assets of the funds, partnerships and accounts to which Apollo provides investment management, advisory, or certain other investment-related services, including, without limitation, capital that such funds, partnerships and accounts have the right to call from investors pursuant to capital commitments. Our AUM equals the sum of: 1. the NAV, plus used or available leverage and/or capital commitments, or gross assets plus capital commitments, of the yield and certain hybrid funds, partnerships and accounts for which we provide investment management or advisory services, other than certain CLOs, CDOs, and certain perpetual capital vehicles, which have a fee-generating basis other than the mark-to-market value of the underlying assets; for certain perpetual capital vehicles in yield, gross asset value plus available financing capacity; 2. the fair value of the investments of the equity and certain hybrid funds, partnerships and accounts Apollo manages or advises, plus the capital that such funds, partnerships and accounts are entitled to call from investors pursuant to capital commitments, plus portfolio level financings; 3. the gross asset value associated with the reinsurance investments of the portfolio company assets Apollo manages or advises; and 4. the fair value of any other assets that Apollo manages or advises for the funds, partnerships and accounts to which Apollo provides investment management, advisory, or certain other investment-related services, plus unused credit facilities, including capital commitments to such funds, partnerships and accounts for investments that may require pre-qualification or other conditions before investment plus any other capital commitments to such funds, partnerships and accounts available for investment that are not otherwise included in the clauses above. Apollos AUM measure includes Assets Under Management for which Apollo charges either nominal or zero fees. Apollos AUM measure also includes assets for which Apollo does not have investment discretion, including certain assets for which Apollo earns only investment-related service fees, rather than management or advisory fees. Apollos definition of AUM is not based on any definition of Assets Under Management contained in its governing documents or in any management agreements of the funds Apollo manages. Apollo considers multiple factors for determining what should be included in its definition of AUM. Such factors include but are not limited to (1) Apollos ability to influence the investment decisions for existing and available assets; (2) Apollos ability to generate income from the underlying assets in the funds it manages; and (3) the AUM measures that Apollo uses internally or believes are used by other investment managers. Given the differences in the investment strategies and structures among other alternative investment managers, Apollos calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations employed by other investment managers and, as a result, this measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Apollos calculation also differs from the manner in which its affiliates registered with the SEC report Regulatory Assets Under Management on Form ADV and Form PF in various ways. Apollo uses AUM, Gross capital deployment and Dry powder as performance measurements of its investment activities, as well as to monitor fund size in relation to professional resource and infrastructure needs. 6 Table of Contents Athene Athene Holding Ltd.

Management fees are normally based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted par asset value, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, stockholders equity, invested capital or capital contributions, each as defined in the applicable management agreement. Monitoring fees, also referred to as advisory fees, with respect to the structured portfolio company investments of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage or advise, are generally based on the total value of such structured portfolio company investments, which normally includes leverage, less any portion of such total value that is already considered in Fee-Generating AUM.

Net invested assets include Athenes (a) total investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with available-for-sale securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. Athene includes the investments supporting assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and excludes the investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in order to match the assets with the income received. Net invested assets include Athenes economic ownership of ACRA investments but do not include the investments associated with the non-controlling interests. Net investment earned rate Computed as income from Athenes net invested assets, excluding the proportionate share of the ACRA net investment income associated with the non-controlling interests, divided by the average net invested assets for the relevant period, presented on an annualized basis for interim periods. Net investment spread Net investment spread measures Athenes investment performance plus its strategic capital management fees less its total cost of funds, presented on an annualized basis for interim periods. Net IRR of accord series and the European principal finance funds The annualized return of a fund after management fees, performance fees allocated to the general partner and certain other expenses, calculated on investors that pay such fees. The terminal value is the net asset value as of the reporting date. Non-USD fund cash flows and residual values are converted to USD using the spot rate as of the reporting date. In addition, net IRR at the fund level will differ from that at the individual investor level as a result of, among other factors, timing of investor-level inflows and outflows. Net IRR does not represent the return to any fund investor. 9 Table of Contents Net IRR of a traditional private equity or the hybrid value funds The gross IRR applicable to a fund, including returns for related parties which may not pay fees or performance fees, net of management fees, certain expenses (including interest incurred or earned by the fund itself) and realized performance fees all offset to the extent of interest income, and measures returns at the fund level on amounts that, if distributed, would be paid to investors of the fund. The timing of cash flows applicable to investments, management fees and certain expenses, may be adjusted for the usage of a funds subscription facility. To the extent that a fund exceeds all requirements detailed within the applicable fund agreement, the estimated unrealized value is adjusted such that a percentage of up to 20.0% of the unrealized gain is allocated to the general partner of such fund, thereby reducing the balance attributable to fund investors. In addition, net IRR at the fund level will differ from that at the individual investor level as a result of, among other factors, timing of investor-level inflows and outflows. Net IRR does not represent the return to any fund investor. Net IRR of infrastructure funds The cumulative cash flows in a fund (and not any one investor in the fund), on the basis of the actual timing of cash inflows received from and outflows paid to investors of the fund (assuming the ending net asset value as of the reporting date or other date specified is paid to investors), excluding certain non-fee and non-performance fee bearing parties, and the return is annualized and compounded after management fees, performance fees, and certain other expenses (including interest incurred by the fund itself) and measures the returns to investors of the fund as a whole. Non-USD fund cash flows and residual values are converted to USD using the spot rate as of the reporting date. In addition, net IRR at the fund level will differ from that at the individual investor level as a result of, among other factors, timing of investor-level inflows and outflows. Net IRR does not represent the return to any fund investor. Net reserve liabilities Represent Athene's policyholder liability obligations net of reinsurance and used to analyze the costs of its liabilities. Net reserve liabilities include Athenes (a) interest sensitive contract liabilities, (b) future policy benefits, (c) net market risk benefits, (d) long-term repurchase obligations, (e) dividends payable to policyholders and (f) other policy claims and benefits, offset by reinsurance recoverable, excluding policy loans ceded. Net reserve liabilities include Athenes economic ownership of ACRA reserve liabilities but do not include the reserve liabilities associated with the non-controlling interests. Net reserve liabilities are net of the ceded liabilities to third-party reinsurers as the costs of the liabilities are passed to such reinsurers and, therefore, Athene has no net economic exposure to such liabilities, assuming its reinsurance counterparties perform under the agreements. Net reserve liabilities include the underlying liabilities assumed through modco reinsurance agreements in order to match the liabilities with the expenses incurred. Net Return or Net ROE of a total return yield fund or the hybrid credit hedge fund The gross return after management fees, performance fees allocated to the general partner, or other fees and expenses. Returns over multiple periods are calculated by geometrically linking each periods return over time. Net return and net ROE do not represent the return to any fund investor.

 1. BUSINESS Index to Business Overview 13 Our Businesses 13 Asset Management 13 Retirement Services 17 Principal Investing 23 Competition 23 Human Capital 24 Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility 25 Regulatory and Compliance Matters 26 Available Information 32 Overview Founded in 1990, Apollo is a high-growth, global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider. Apollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing. These business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies. Our Businesses Asset Management Our Asset Management segment focuses on three investing strategies: yield, hybrid and equity. These strategies reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform based on relative risk and return. As an asset manager, we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base. The amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy, liquidity profile, and, ultimately our ability to generate returns for our clients. We also earn capital solutions fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizable private equity franchise. After expenses, we call the resulting earning stream Fee Related Earnings or FRE, which represents the primary performance measure for the Asset Management segment. As of December 31, 2023, we had total AUM of $650.8 billion. Our Asset Management segment had a team of 2,903 employees as of December 31, 2023, with offices throughout the world. This team possesses a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills. We operate our asset management business in a highly integrated manner, which we believe distinguishes us from other alternative asset managers. Our investment teams frequently collaborate across disciplines and we believe that this collaboration enables our clients to more successfully invest across a companys capital structure. Our objective is to achieve superior long-term risk-adjusted returns for our clients. The majority of the investment funds we manage are designed to invest capital over a period of several years from inception, thereby allowing us to seek to generate attractive long-term returns throughout economic cycles. We have a contrarian, value-oriented investment approach, emphasizing downside protection, and the preservation of capital. We believe our contrarian investment approach is reflected in a number of ways, including:  our willingness to pursue investments in industries that our competitors typically avoid;  the often complex structures employed in some of the investments of our funds;  our experience investing during periods of uncertainty or distress in the economy or financial markets; and  our willingness to undertake transactions that have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. 13 Table of Contents We have applied this investment philosophy to identify what we believe are attractive investment opportunities, deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading, or franchise, businesses and create value throughout economic cycles. Yield Yield is our largest asset management strategy with $480.5 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. Our yield strategy focuses on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets, through our affiliated origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe-yielding assets for the investors in the funds we manage. Within our yield strategy, we target 4% to 10% returns for our clients. Since inception, the total return yield fund has generated a 6% gross Return on Equity (ROE) and 5% net ROE annualized through December 31, 2023. The investment portfolios of the yield-oriented funds Apollo manages include several asset classes, as described below:  Corporate Fixed Income ($116.4 billion of AUM), which generally includes investment grade corporate bonds, emerging markets investments and investment grade private placement investments;  Corporate Credit ($87.1 billion of AUM), which includes performing credit investments, including income-oriented, senior loan and bond investments involving issuers primarily domiciled in the U.S. and in Europe as well as investment grade asset-backed securities;  Structured Credit ($95.7 billion of AUM), which includes corporate structured and asset-backed securities as well as consumer and residential real estate credit investments;  Real Estate Debt ($44.6 billion of AUM), including debt investments across a broad spectrum of property types and at various points within a propertys capital structure, including first mortgage and mezzanine financing and preferred equity; and  Direct Origination ($41.4 billion of AUM), which includes originations (both directly with sponsors and through banks) and investments in loans primarily related to middle market lending and aviation finance. Hybrid Our hybrid strategy, with $62.5 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023, brings together our capabilities across debt and equity to seek to offer a differentiated risk-adjusted return with an emphasis on structured downside protected opportunities across asset classes. We target 8% to 15% returns within our hybrid strategy by pursuing investments in all market environments, deploying capital during both periods of dislocation and market strength, and focusing on different investing strategies and asset classes. The flagship hybrid credit hedge fund we manage has generated an 11% gross ROE and a 7% net ROE annualized and the hybrid value funds we manage have generated a 20% gross IRR and a 15% net IRR from inception through December 31, 2023. The investing strategies and asset classes within our hybrid strategy are described below:  Accord and Credit Strategies ($11.7 billion of AUM), which refers to the investment strategy of certain funds managed by Apollo that invest opportunistically in both the primary and secondary markets in order to seek to capitalize on both near- and longer-term relative value across market cycles. The investment portfolios of these funds include credit investments in a broad array of primary and secondary opportunities encompassing stressed and distressed public and private securities, including senior loans (secured and unsecured), large corporate investment grade loan origination and structured capital solutions, high yield, mezzanine, derivative securities, debtor in possession financings, rescue or bridge financings, and other debt investments.  Hybrid Value ($10.4 billion of AUM), which refers to the investment strategy of certain funds managed by Apollo that focus on providing companies with, among other things, rescue financing or customized capital solutions, including senior secured and unsecured debt or preferred equity securities, often with equity-linked or equity-like upside, as well as structured equity investments.  Infrastructure Equity ($6.2 billion of AUM), which refers to the investment strategy of certain funds managed by Apollo that focus on investing in a broad range of infrastructure assets, including communications, midstream energy, power and renewables, and transportation related assets. 14 Table of Contents  Hybrid Real Estate ($6.0 billion of AUM), which includes our real estate income focused strategies, including core, core plus and net lease investments. Our hybrid real estate strategy consists of public and private funds that focus on investing in substantially stabilized commercial real estate properties across property types and geographies, both in the United States and in Europe. Equity Our equity strategy represents $107.9 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. Our equity strategy emphasizes flexibility, complexity, and purchase price discipline to drive opportunistic-like returns for our clients throughout market cycles. Apollos equity team has experience across sectors, industries, and geographies in both private equity and real estate equity. Our control equity transactions are principally buyouts, corporate carveouts and distressed investments, while the real estate funds we manage generally transact in single asset, portfolio and platform acquisitions. Within our equity strategy, we target returns above 15% in the funds we manage. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in the traditional private equity funds we manage, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2023. Our equity strategy focuses on several investing strategies as described below:  Flagship Private Equity ($76.7 billion of AUM) , which refers to our investment strategy focused on creating investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns across industries and geographies and throughout market cycles, utilizing our value-oriented investment approach. Through this strategy, we seek to build portfolios of investments that are created at meaningful discounts to comparable market multiples of adjusted cash flow, thereby resulting in what we believe are portfolios focused on capital preservation. The transactions in this strategy include opportunistic buyouts, corporate carveouts and distressed investments. After their acquisition by an Apollo-managed fund, Apollo works with the portfolio companies of the funds it manages to seek to accelerate growth and execute a value creation strategy. Included within flagship private equity are assets related to our impact investment strategy, which pursues private equity-like investment opportunities with the intention of generating a positive, measurable, social and/or environmental impact while also seeking to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The impact investment strategy targets investment opportunities across five core impact-aligned investment themes: (i) economic opportunity, (ii) education; (iii) health, safety and wellness; (iv) industry 4.0; and (v) climate and sustainability.  European Principal Finance (EPF) ($8.1 billion of AUM), which refers to our investment strategy focused on European commercial and residential real estate, performing loans, non-performing loans, and unsecured consumer loans, as well as acquiring assets as a result of distressed market situations. Certain of the European Principal Finance vehicles we manage also own captive pan-European financial institutions, loan servicing and property management platforms that perform banking and lending activities and manage and service consumer credit receivables and loans secured by commercial and residential properties.  Real Estate Equity ($5.9 billion of AUM), which refers to our value add and opportunistic investment strategies that target investments in real estate and real estate-related assets, portfolios and platforms located across various real estate asset classes in regionally focused private funds in both the United States and Asia. Perpetual Capital Included within our investing strategies above is $378.3 billion of perpetual capital, out of the $650.8 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, perpetual capital includes, without limitation, certain assets in our yield strategy, including assets relating to publicly traded and non-traded vehicles, certain origination platform assets and assets managed for certain of our retirement services clients. Perpetual capital assets may be withdrawn under certain circumstances and utilize a range of investment strategies, including those described previously. Athene Apollos asset management business, through its consolidated subsidiary, ISG, provides a full suite of services for Athenes investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence, and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk

Athora Apollos asset management business, through its consolidated subsidiary, ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of Apollo funds and Athora, a strategic liabilities platform that acquires or reinsures blocks of insurance business in the German and broader European life insurance market (collectively, the Athora Accounts). As of December 31, 2023, Apollo, through its subsidiaries, managed or advised $49.9 billion of AUM and $48.0 billion of Fee-Generating AUM in Athora Accounts. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the fee arrangements between the Company and Athora. Athora Non-Sub-Advised Assets This category includes the Athora assets which are managed by Apollo but not sub-advised by Apollo nor invested in Apollo funds or investment vehicles. We refer to these assets collectively as Athora Non-Sub-Advised Assets. Our AUM within the Athora Non-Sub-Advised category totaled $28.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, of which $26.9 billion was Fee-Generating AUM. Capital Solutions Our capital solutions business focuses on (i) sourcing investment opportunities for asset management clients and their respective portfolio investments, (ii) maintaining relationships with the capital markets community in an effort to help clients and their respective portfolio investments to raise debt and equity capital and optimize capital structures through creative financing solutions, and (iii) structuring capital solutions in an effort to enhance our ability to syndicate, place or otherwise transfer loans, securities and other financial instruments arising from financings in an effort to drive positive outcomes for our asset management clients and their respective portfolio investments. Our capital solutions business also provides a variety of services with respect to both security and non-security financial instruments, including loans, such as originating, arranging, structuring, and syndicating loans and private debt, as well as providing advisory services and other similar services. Fundraising and Investor Relations Within the asset management business, our fundraising strategy consists of yield, hybrid, and equity strategies. We raise private capital from prominent institutional investors, and from public market investors, as in the case of MFIC, AFT, AIF and ARI. In our equity strategy and certain funds in our hybrid strategy, fundraising activities for new funds begin once the investor capital commitments for the current fund are largely invested or committed to be invested. The investor base includes new investors and investors from prior funds, which in many instances have increased their commitments to subsequent funds. Fund X held its final close with approximately $20 billion in commitments, having concluded the fundraise within its twelve-month fundraising period. We received strong support from both new and existing investors, with significant commitments from investors new to the Apollo platform as well as existing investors who meaningfully renewed their commitments. Fund X benefits from a diverse and prominent group of limited partners, including public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, private wealth platforms, family offices, high net worth individuals, and other institutional investors. In addition, many of our investment professionals commit their own capital to each flagship equity fund. We maintain a rigorous investment process for yield, hybrid, and equity investments, and have in place procedures to allocate investment opportunities among the funds we manage. We have professionals responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, performing due diligence on, negotiating, executing, monitoring and exiting investments for our traditional equity funds, and yield and hybrid funds we manage, respectively, as well as for pursuing operational improvements in the funds portfolio companies through management consulting arrangements in case of equity funds. Our investment committees for relevant funds review the analyses of prospective investments, and ultimately approve recommended investments and dispositions. The processes by which the funds we manage receive and invest capital vary by investing strategy and type of fund. However, in all types of funds we manage, investors deliver capital when called by us as investment opportunities become available. We also have several perpetual capital vehicles with unlimited duration that raise capital by issuing equity securities in the public markets and can also issue debt. Our hedge fund style yield funds, generally structured as limited partnerships with customary redemption rights, continuously offer and sell shares or limited partner interests via private placements through monthly subscriptions, which are payable in full upon a funds acceptance of an investors subscription. The general partners capital 16 Table of Contents commitment is determined through negotiation with the funds underlying investor base, and commitments are generally available for approximately six years. Generally, as each investment is realized, these funds first return the capital and expenses related to that investment and any previously realized investments to fund investors and then distribute any profits (which are typically shared 80% to the investors in equity funds and 20% to us, so long as the investors receive at least an 8% compounded annual return on their investment). Allocation of profits between fund investors and us, and the amount of the preferred return, among other provisions, varies for hybrid funds as well as many yield funds. Ownership interests in equity funds are not subject to redemption prior to termination of the funds. Our aim has been to build value in the portfolio companies of the hybrid and equity funds we manage. We are actively engaged with the management teams of these portfolio companies to maximize the underlying value of the business, by taking a holistic approach to value-creation and concentrating on both the asset side and liability side of the balance sheet of a company. These portfolio companies seek to capture discounts on publicly traded debt securities through exchange offers and potential debt buybacks. Our established group purchasing program helps the funds' portfolio companies leverage the combined corporate spending among Apollo and portfolio companies of the funds it manages in order to seek to reduce costs, optimize payment terms and improve service levels for all program participants. The value of the investments that have been made by funds are typically realized through either an initial public offering of common stock on a nationally recognized exchange or through the private sale of the companies in which funds have invested. General Partner and Professionals Investments and Co-Investments General Partner Investments Certain management companies, general partners and co-invest vehicles are committed to contribute to the funds we manage and their affiliates. As a limited partner, general partner and manager of the Apollo funds, Apollo had unfunded capital commitments as of December 31, 2023 of $627 million. Professionals Investments To further align our interests with those of investors in the funds we manage, certain of our professionals have invested their own capital in the funds. Our professionals will either re-invest their performance fees to fund these investments or use cash on hand or funds borrowed from third parties. We generally have not historically charged management fees or performance fees on capital invested by our professionals directly in the funds. Co-Investments Investors in many of the funds we manage, as well as certain other investors, may have the opportunity to make co-investments with the funds. Co-investments are investments in portfolio companies or other fund assets generally on the same terms and conditions as those to which the applicable fund is subject. Retirement Services Our retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athene is led by a highly skilled management team with extensive industry experience and has its corporate headquarters located in West Des Moines, Iowa. Our asset management business provides a full suite of services for Athenes investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. As of December 31, 2023, Athene had 1,976 employees. Our retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with Athenes preferred risk and return characteristics. Athenes investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk and capitalize on its long-dated, persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. A cornerstone of Athenes investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business, modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance. Because Athene maintains discipline in 17 Table of Contents underwriting attractively priced liabilities, it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high-quality assets to generate attractive earnings. Our asset management expertise supports the sourcing and underwriting of assets for Athenes portfolio. Athene is invested in a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene establishes risk thresholds which in turn define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk and caps on specific asset classes. In addition to other efforts, Athene partially mitigates the risk of rising interest rates by strategically allocating a meaningful portion of its investment portfolio into floating rate securities. Athene also maintains holdings in less interest rate-sensitive investments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products, consistent with its strategy of pursuing incremental yield by assuming liquidity and complexity risk, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Rather than increase its allocation to higher risk securities to increase yield, Athene pursues the direct origination of high-quality, predominantly senior secured assets, which it believes possess greater alpha-generating qualities than securities that would otherwise be readily available in public markets. These direct origination strategies include investments sourced by (1) affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which Athene gains exposure directly to the loan or indirectly through its ownership of the origination platform and/or securitizations of assets originated by the origination platform, and (2) our asset management teams extensive network of direct relationships with predominantly investment-grade counterparties. Athene uses, and may continue to use, derivatives, including swaps, options, futures and forward contracts and reinsurance contracts to hedge risks such as current or future changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities, current or future changes in cash flows and changes in interest rates, equity markets, currency fluctuations and longevity. Products Athene principally offers two product lines: annuities and funding agreements. Annuities Athenes primary product line is annuities, which include FIAs, Fixed Rate Annuities, Registered Index-Linked Annuities (RILAs), Payout Annuities and Group Annuities. Fixed Indexed Annuities. FIAs are the largest percentage of Athenes net reserve liabilities. FIAs are a type of insurance contract in which the policyholder makes one or more premium deposits that earn interest, on a tax deferred basis, at a crediting rate based on a specified market index, subject to a specified cap, spread or participation rate. FIAs allow policyholders the possibility of earning interest without significant risk to principal, unless the contract is surrendered during a surrender charge period. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks or other assets representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases, an entire market. Athene generally buys options on the indices to which the FIAs are tied to hedge the associated market risk. The cost of the option is priced into the overall economics of the product as an option budget. Athene generates income on FIA products by earning an investment spread, based on the difference between (1) income earned on the investments supporting the liabilities and (2) the cost of funds, including fixed interest credited to customers, option costs, the cost of providing guarantees (net of rider fees), policy issuance and maintenance costs and commission costs. Fixed Rate Annuities. Fixed rate annuities include annual reset annuities and multi-year guarantee annuities (MYGA). Unlike FIAs, fixed rate annuities earn interest at a set rate (or declared crediting rate), rather than at a rate that may vary based on an index. Fixed rate annual reset annuities have a crediting rate that is typically guaranteed for one year. After such period, Athene has the ability to change the crediting rate at its discretion, generally once annually, to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. MYGAs are similar to annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years, rather than just one year, before it may be changed at Athenes discretion. After the initial crediting period, MYGAs can generally be reset annually. Registered Index-Linked Annuities. RILAs are similar to FIAs in offering the policyholder the opportunity for tax-deferred growth based in part on the performance of a market index. Compared to an FIA, RILAs have the potential for higher returns but also have the potential for risk of loss to principal and related earnings. RILAs provide the ability for the policyholder to participate in the positive performance of certain market indices during a term, limited by a cap or adjusted for a participation rate. Negative performance of the market indices during a term can result in negative policyholder returns, with downside 18 Table of Contents protection typically provided in the form of either a buffer or a floor to limit the policyholders exposure to market loss. A buffer is protection from negative exposure up to a certain percentage, typically 10 or 20 percent. A floor is protection from negative exposure less than a stated percentage (i.e., the policyholder risks exposure of loss up to the floor, but is protected against any loss in excess of this amount). Private Placement Variable Annuities (PPVA). PPVAs are not registered with the SEC and currently are only offered by private placement to purchasers meeting both the requirements as a qualified purchaser and an accredited investor under applicable federal securities laws. Variable annuities allow policyholders to participate directly in the investment experience of the underlying investment vehicles offered through the product. In a variable annuity, the policyholder assumes the full investment risk of the investment options chosen. The product allows the policyholder to allocate their money to a variety of variable separate account divisions that invest in a suite of underlying investment options and the potential to accumulate cash value on a tax-deferred basis. Athenes PPVA product provides access to a suite of Apollo managed funds and other product offerings with no surrender charges and no guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit or guaranteed death benefit features. Athene generates income on its PPVA product by collecting a management fee that is a function of the policyholders account value. Income Riders to Fixed Annuity Products. The income riders on Athenes deferred annuities can be broadly categorized as either guaranteed or participating. Guaranteed income riders provide policyholders with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit, which permits policyholders to elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from their contract without having to annuitize their policies. Participating income riders tend to have lower levels of guaranteed income than guaranteed income riders but provide policyholders the opportunity to receive greater levels of income if the policies indexed crediting strategies perform well. As of December 31, 2023, 28% of Athenes deferred annuity account value contained rider benefits. Withdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities . After the first year following the issuance of a deferred annuity, the policyholder is typically permitted to make withdrawals up to 5% or 10% (depending on the contract) of the prior years value without a surrender charge or market value adjustment (MVA), subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of the allowable amounts are assessed a surrender charge and MVA if such withdrawals are made during the surrender charge period of the policy, which generally ranges from 3 to 20 years. The surrender charge for most Athene products at contract inception is generally between 7% and 15% of the contract value and decreases by approximately one percentage point per year during the surrender charge period. The weighted average surrender charge (excluding the impact of MVAs) was 6% for Athenes deferred annuities as of December 31, 2023. At maturity, the policyholder may elect to receive proceeds in the form of a single payment or an annuity. If the annuity option is selected, the policyholder will receive a series of payments either over the policyholders lifetime or over a fixed number of years, depending upon the terms of the contract. Some contracts permit annuitization prior to maturity. Payout Annuities. Payout annuities primarily consist of single premium immediate annuities (SPIA), supplemental contracts and structured settlements. Payout annuities provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, based upon the policyholders election at the time of issuance. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. Supplemental contracts are typically created upon the conversion of a death claim or the annuitization of a deferred annuity. Structured settlements generally relate to legal settlements. Group Annuities . Group annuities issued in connection with pension group annuity transactions usually involve a single premium group annuity contract issued to discharge certain pension plan liabilities. The group annuities that Athene issues are nonparticipating contracts. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract may be held in a separate account. Group annuity benefits may be purchased for current, retired and/or terminated employees and their beneficiaries covered under terminating or continuing pension plans. Both immediate and deferred annuity certificates may be issued pursuant to a single group annuity contract. Immediate annuity certificates cover those retirees and beneficiaries currently receiving payments, whereas deferred annuity certificates cover those participants who have not yet begun receiving benefit payments. Immediate annuity certificates have no cash surrender rights, whereas deferred annuity certificates may include an election to receive a lump sum payment, exercisable by the participant upon either the participant achieving a specified age or the occurrence of a specified event, such as termination of the participants employment. Athene earns income on group annuities based upon the spread between the return on the assets received in connection with the pension group annuity transaction and the cost of the pension obligations assumed. Group annuities expose Athene to longevity risk, which would be realized if plan participants live longer than assumed in underwriting the transaction, resulting in 19 Table of Contents aggregate payments that exceed Athenes expectations. However, Athenes conservative underwriting process makes use of a wealth of reliable pre- and post-selection participant data, including mortality experience data, particularly for mid- to large-sized transactions, to mitigate this risk. Funding Agreements Funding agreements include those issued to institutions and to special-purpose unaffiliated trusts in connection with Athenes FABN and secured FABR programs. Funding agreements are issued opportunistically to institutional investors at attractive risk-adjusted funding costs. Funding agreements are negotiated privately between an investor and an insurance company. They are designed to provide an agreement holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments, while offering competitive yields and predictable returns. The interest rate can be fixed or floating. Athene also includes repurchase agreements with a term that exceeds one year at the time of execution within the funding agreement product category. Life and Other Life and other products include life insurance policies assumed through reinsurance transactions, other retail products, including legacy run-off or ceded business, and statutory closed blocks. Distribution Channels Athene has developed four dedicated distribution channels to address the retirement services market: retail, flow reinsurance, institutional, and acquisitions and block reinsurance, which support opportunistic origination across different market environments. Additionally, Athene believes these distribution channels enable it to achieve stable asset growth while maintaining attractive returns. Retail Athene has built a scalable platform that allows it to originate and rapidly grow its business in deferred annuity products. Athene has developed a suite of retirement savings products, distributed through its network of 51 independent marketing organizations (IMOs) and a growing network of 18 banks and 144 broker-dealers, collectively representing approximately 128,000 independent agents in all 50 states. Athene is focused in every aspect of its retail channel on providing high quality products and service to its policyholders and maintaining appropriate financial protection over the life of their policies. Flow Reinsurance Flow reinsurance provides another channel for Athene to source liabilities with attractive crediting rates and offers insurance companies the opportunity to improve their product offerings and enhance their financial results. As in the retail channel, Athene does not pursue flow volume growth at the expense of profitability and will respond rapidly to adjust pricing for changes in asset yields. Reinsurance is an arrangement under which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the ceding company or cedant, for all or a portion of certain insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company. Reinsurance is designed to (1) reduce the net amount at risk on individual risks, thereby enabling the ceding company to increase the volume of business it can underwrite, as well as increase the maximum risk it can underwrite on a single risk, (2) stabilize operating results by reducing volatility in the ceding companys loss experience, (3) assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory requirements and (4) enhance the ceding companys financial strength and surplus position. Within its flow reinsurance channel, Athene conducts third-party flow reinsurance transactions through its insurance subsidiaries. As a reinsurer, Athene partners with insurance companies to develop solutions to their capital requirements, enhance their presence in the retirement market and improve their financial results. Athene targets reinsuring spread-based liabilities which can include FIAs, MYGAs, traditional one-year guarantee fixed deferred annuities, immediate annuities, whole life insurance, universal life insurance and institutional products. 20 Table of Contents Institutional Athenes institutional channel includes funding agreements and pension group annuity transactions. Funding Agreements . Funding agreements are comprised of funding agreements issued under Athenes FABN and FABR programs, funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and long-term repurchase agreements. Athenes FABN program allows its special-purpose, unaffiliated statutory trust to offer its senior secured medium-term notes. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors. The net proceeds of the issuance of notes are used by the trust to purchase one or more funding agreements from Athene subsidiaries with matching interest and maturity payment terms. Athene also established a secured FABR program in which a special-purpose, unaffiliated entity enters into a repurchase agreement with a bank and the proceeds of the repurchase agreement are used by the special-purpose entity to purchase funding agreements from Athene subsidiaries. Athene is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and, through membership, has issued funding agreements to the FHLB in exchange for cash advances. Athene is required to provide collateral in excess of the funding agreement amounts outstanding, considering any discounts to the securities posted and prepayment penalties. Athene also includes long-term repurchase agreements with a term that exceeds one year at the time of execution within the funding agreement product category. Pension Group Annuities. Athene partners with institutions seeking to transfer and thereby reduce their obligation to pay future pension benefits to retirees and deferred participants through pension group annuities. Athene works with advisors, brokers and consultants to source pension group annuity transactions and design solutions that meet the needs of prospective pension group annuity counterparties and their participants, with a focus on medium- and large-sized deals involving retirees and/or deferred participants that are structured as either a buyout or a buy-in transaction. Acquisitions and Block Reinsurance Acquisitions . Acquisitions are a complementary source of growth for our retirement services business. Athene has a proven ability to acquire businesses in complex transactions at favorable terms, manage the liabilities acquired and reinvest the associated assets. Block Reinsurance . Through block reinsurance transactions, Athene partners with life and annuity companies to decrease their exposure to one or more products or to divest of lower-margin or non-core segments of their businesses. Unlike acquisitions in which Athene acquires the assets or stock of a target company, block reinsurance allows Athene to contractually assume assets and liabilities associated with a certain book of business. In doing so, Athene contractually assumes responsibility for only that portion of the business that it deems desirable, without assuming additional liabilities. As Athene continues to expand to new markets and geographies, it has been disciplined in only retaining liabilities that are core to its strategy and competitive advantages. This can be accomplished through structural solutions, including mortality and longevity reinsurance. Capital Athene believes it has a strong capital position and is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using an internal capital model which reflects managements view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athenes core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. Deployable Capital Athenes deployable capital is comprised of capital from three sources: excess equity capital, untapped debt capacity and available undrawn capital commitments from ACRA. As of December 31, 2023, Athene estimates that it had approximately $8.0 billion in capital available to deploy, consisting of approximately $2.6 billion in excess equity capital, $3.8 billion in 21 Table of Contents untapped debt capacity (assuming a peer average adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio of 25%, which is subject to general availability and market conditions), and $1.6 billion in available undrawn capital at ACRA. ACRA In order to support growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities, Athene established ACRA 1 as a long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Athene owns 36.55% of ACRA 1s economic interests and all of ACRA 1s voting interests, with the remaining 63.45% of the economic interests being owned by ADIP I. During the commitment period, ACRA 1 participated in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP Is proportionate economic interests in ACRA 1. The commitment period for ACRA 1 expired in August 2023. To further support its growth and capital deployment opportunities following the deployment of capital by ACRA 1, Athene funded ACRA 2 in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50% of its non-voting, economic interests in ACRA 2 to ADIP II for $640 million, while maintaining all of ACRA 2s voting interests. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP IIs ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60%, with ALRe owning the remaining 40% of economic interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP IIs proportionate economic interests in ACRA 2. These strategic capital solutions are designed to provide Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues and sustain a profitable growth strategy at scale in a capital efficient manner, while maintaining a strong financial position. Uses of Capital Athenes capital deployment includes the payment for a business opportunity, such as the payment of a ceding commission to enter into a block reinsurance transaction, and the retention of capital based on Athenes internal capital model. Currently, Athene deploys capital in four primary ways: (1) supporting organic growth, (2) supporting inorganic growth, (3) making dividend payments to AGM, and (4) retaining capital to support financial strength ratings upgrades. Athene generally seeks mid-teen or higher returns on its capital deployment. Reinsurance Internal Ceded Reinsurance Subject to quota shares generally ranging from 80% to 100%, substantially all of the existing deposits held and new deposits generated by Athenes U.S. insurance subsidiaries are reinsured to its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries. Athene maintains the same reserving principles for its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries as it does for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Athene also retrocedes certain inorganic transactions, pension group annuity transactions, funding agreement transactions, and retail and flow reinsurance business to ACRA. Athenes internal reinsurance structure provides it with several strategic and operational advantages, including the aggregation of regulatory capital, which makes the aggregate capital of its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries available to support the risks assumed by each entity, and enhanced operating efficiencies. As a result of its internal reinsurance structure and third-party direct to Bermuda business, a significant majority of Athenes aggregate capital is held by its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries. Third-Party Ceded Reinsurance In addition, from time to time, Athene may opportunistically cede certain of its business from its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, or Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, to third party reinsurers, to generate capital and/or limit exposure to certain risks. Ratings As of December 31, 2023, each of Athenes significant insurance subsidiaries is rated A, A1 or A by the four rating agencies that evaluate the financial strength of such subsidiaries. To achieve its financial strength ratings aspirations, Athene may choose to retain additional capital above the level required by the rating agencies to support operating needs. Athene believes there are numerous benefits to achieving stronger ratings over time, including increased recognition of and confidence in its financial strength by prospective business partners, particularly within product distribution, as well as potential 22 Table of Contents profitability improvements in certain organic channels through lower funding costs. Financial strength and credit ratings directly affect Athenes ability to access funding and the related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain Athene products to customers, its attractiveness as a reinsurer to potential ceding companies and the requirements for collateral posting on its derivatives. These ratings are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Principal Investing Our Principal Investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income, realized investment income from our balance sheet investments, and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company. The Principal Investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at AGM. Over time, we may deploy capital into strategic investments that help accelerate the growth of our Asset Management segment, by broadening our investment management and/or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations. We believe these investments may translate into greater compounded annual growth of Fee Related Earnings. Given the cyclical nature of performance fees, earnings from our Principal Investing segment, or PII, are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. We earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees, primarily investment professionals, with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time. To enhance this alignment, we have increased the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over the last few years. Competition Asset Management Within the asset management business, Apollo operates in an intensely competitive industry, and expects it to remain so. We compete globally and on a regional, industry and niche basis. We face competition both in the pursuit of investor capital and in making investments on behalf of funds and accounts we manage across yield, hybrid and equity asset classes. We compete for investor capital based on a variety of factors, including:  investment performance as a metric for assessing excess return per unit of risk;  investor perception of investment managers drive, focus and alignment of interest;  quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;  business reputation; and  the level of fees and expenses charged for services. Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively within our industry will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. Retirement Services Athene operates in highly competitive markets. It faces a variety of large and small industry participants, including diversified financial institutions and insurance and reinsurance companies. These companies compete in one form or another for the growing pool of retirement assets driven by a number of external factors such as the continued aging of the population and the reduction in safety nets provided by governments and private employers. In the markets in which Athene operates, scale and the ability to provide value-added services and build long-term relationships are important factors to compete effectively. Athene believes that its leading presence in the retirement services market, diverse range of capabilities and broad distribution network uniquely position it to effectively serve consumers increasing demand for retirement solutions. Athene faces competition in the FIA market from traditional insurance carriers. Principal competitive factors for FIAs are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of products and services. 23 Table of Contents Reinsurance markets are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As a reinsurer, Athene competes based on many factors, including, among other things, financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements, reputation, service, and experience in the types of business underwritten. The impact of these and other factors is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas, and distribution channels. Within the reinsurance market, Athene competes with other insurance and reinsurance companies. Athene faces strong competition within its institutional channel. With respect to funding agreements, namely those issued in connection with its FABN program, Athene competes with other insurers that have active FABN programs. Within the funding agreement market, it competes primarily on the basis of perceived financial strength, interest rates and term. With respect to group annuities, Athene competes with other insurers that offer such annuities. Within the pension group annuities market, it competes primarily on the basis of price, underwriting, investment capabilities and its ability to provide quality service to the corporate sponsors pension participants. Finally, Athene faces competition in the market for acquisition targets and profitable blocks of insurance. Such competition is likely to intensify as insurance businesses become more attractive acquisition targets for both other insurance companies and financial and other institutions and as the already substantial consolidation in the financial services industry continues. Athene competes for potential acquisition and block reinsurance opportunities based on a number of factors including perceived financial strength, brand recognition, reputation and the pricing it is able to offer, which, to the extent Athene determines to finance a transaction, is in turn dependent on its ability to do so on suitable terms. Athene believes its demonstrated ability to source and consummate large and complex transactions is a competitive advantage over other potential acquirers. For additional information concerning the

Our benefits programs are intended to support our employees and their families, and include healthcare, wellness initiatives, retirement programs, paid time off and family leave. 24 Table of Contents Expanding Opportunity Expanding opportunity is an important part of our culture and is focused on three specific areas  workplace, marketplace and community. Our people are actively engaged in expanding opportunity across these dimensions. We are keenly focused on how we attract, develop, and retain great talent from all backgrounds at Apollo. Guided by the principle that well-managed, diverse teams outperform, we work hard to leverage a range of perspectives to solve complex problems for our clients. We believe that an engaged and inclusive workforce will bring the best ideas to innovate and drive value for our clients and the communities in which we operate. Citizenship Apollo seeks to actively invest in our communities and engage our employees and other stakeholders in meaningful and impactful Citizenship Programs. Apollo offers its employees philanthropic, volunteer, and other forms of engagement to strengthen communities and expand opportunity around the globe. To empower employees to give back, Apollo hosts volunteer events and provides Citizenship Grants for matching gifts and volunteer rewards each year. Apollo is proud to amplify the efforts of employees, supporting the communities in which they live and the causes and organizations of greatest importance to them. Apollo Opportunity Foundation The Apollo Opportunity Foundation was launched in February 2022 to invest in non-profit organizations working to expand opportunity for underrepresented individuals. The Apollo Opportunity Foundations mission is to expand opportunity in communities where our employees live and work around the globe by deploying our capital and engaging our people to invest in career education, workforce development and economic empowerment for all. The Apollo Opportunity Foundation seeks to partner with organizations that are championed by our people to advance economic prosperity and expand opportunity for underrepresented individuals. Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility At Apollo, we believe that taking sustainability and environmental, social and governance factors into account can help drive value creation, and we recognize the unique opportunity to do well by doing good through investments. We believe Apollo is uniquely positioned to drive a more sustainable future and expand opportunity in our workplace, the marketplace, and throughout the communities where we work and live. Accordingly, Apollo has taken an integrated approach to incorporating relevant environmental, social, and governance considerations into how we invest, how we lend, and how we operate our firm globally. Our sustainability strategy prioritizes the creation of economic value for our shareholders and serving the needs of our clients and employees in a responsible way. We believe sustainability is more than simply a negative screen, a risk mitigator, or a due diligence lens; rather, we believe it is a potential driver of returns and growth. Accordingly, we view sustainable investment to be the strategy and practice of incorporating environmental, social, and governance factors and sustainability outcomes into investment decisions, practices, and ownership, to the extent they are deemed to be material to financial performance and consistent with fiduciary obligations. Where appropriate, we seek to: engage with portfolio companies and issuers on financially material issues; report on our activities and progress and the activities and progress of portfolio companies of the funds we manage, to fund investors, shareholders, and stakeholders alike; and support the implementation of best practices across the alternative asset management and retirement services industries. We have a committee of the AGM board of directors, the sustainability and corporate responsibility committee, which is responsible for assisting the board of directors in overseeing corporate responsibility and sustainability matters. In 2023, our chief sustainability officer, in coordination with the sustainability and corporate responsibility committee, reviewed and approved updates to our sustainable investing and environmental, social, and governance policy and our corporate political activities policy. We also adopted several new policies, including an environmental, health and safety policy, a human rights policy, and a supplier code of conduct. In addition, consistent with our strategic approach to climate-related financial transparency, we expanded our voluntary disclosures included in our annual sustainability report, which is available on our website, to include financed emissions data, carbon footprint data, weighted average carbon intensity, and weighted average data quality scores for certain investments held by select Apollo-managed funds. 25 Table of Contents Regulatory and Compliance Matters Our businesses, as well as the financial services and insurance industries generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations, some of which are summarized below. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds, insurance companies, broker-dealers and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory and compliance requirements may result in a variety of consequences, including fines, administrative measures, suspension of voting rights, suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time or mandatory disposal of interests in any affected regulated entity, revocation of investment adviser, insurance, broker-dealer and other registrations, licenses or charters, censures and other regulatory sanctions. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business are ever evolving and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. The complex regulatory frameworks governing financial institutions, insurance companies, insurance distributors and their respective holding companies and subsidiaries, as well as those with investments in them, are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. Financial Services Regulation Our financial services businesses, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are regulated under, among others, the Investment Advisers Act; the Investment Company Act; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act); the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; the European Union and U.K. Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive; the European Union Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) and similar non-U.S. regulators; the Federal Reserve; the SEC; FINRA; the U.S. Department of Labor; the Internal Revenue Service; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Federal Communications Commission; banking and financial regulators in the European Union, its member states and the United Kingdom; as well as rules and regulations over CLO risk retention, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, over the counter derivatives markets, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, gaming companies and natural resources companies. Regulation under the Investment Advisers Act . We conduct our advisory business primarily through our directly owned investment adviser subsidiaries, including Apollo Capital Management, L.P., Apollo Investment Management, L.P., Apollo Credit Management, LLC, ARIS Management, LLC, Apollo Capital Credit Adviser, LLC, Apollo Real Estate Fund Adviser, LLC and Apollo Manager, LLC, each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Apollo Capital Management, L.P. has a number of relying advisers that operate a single advisory business and rely on umbrella registration to be deemed registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. All of our SEC-registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act, including, among other things, maintaining an effective compliance program reasonably designed for our business, maintaining a Code of Ethics for employee trading, marketing, disclosure, custody, and acting consistently with each advisers fiduciary duty to its clients. Regulation as a Broker-Dealer . Apollo Global Securities, LLC (AGS), Griffin Capital Securities, LLC (GCS) and Athene Securities, LLC (Athene Securities), each of which is a subsidiary of Apollo, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and in the U.S. states and territories and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, the implementation of a supervisory control system and effective compliance program, advertising and sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public securities offerings, maintenance of adequate net capital, financial reporting, record keeping, and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees and other associated persons. State 26 Table of Contents securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over AGS, GCS and Athene Securities. In addition, one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, Apollo Capital Solutions Europe B.V., is regulated under relevant broker-dealer regulations in the Netherlands. See Regulated Entities Outside of the U.S. below. Regulation as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor . Certain investment activities in which Apollo managers engage may subject those managers to provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, including registration as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor. Apollo intends to rely on exemptions from registration when available. In addition, certain of the funds we manage are registered management investment companies under the Investment Company Act. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other parties, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as economic sanctions and export control laws administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State. As a result of certain investments of ours and the funds we manage in financial institutions that operate outside of the United States, Apollo is subject to regulatory supervision by international financial regulators, including European Union, European Union member state and U.K. financial regulators and applicable requirements set forth in the relevant banking, consumer finance and other financial services regulations of such jurisdictions. In certain cases, such regulations impose suitability and conduct standards on the Company and require notice to and in certain instances approval of, the relevant regulatory authority of an intent to increase or decrease holdings in the relevant entity outside of specified thresholds, or other contemplated changes in structure, or transactions. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may result in a variety of consequences, including fines, administrative measures, suspension of voting rights, mandatory disposal of interests in the regulated entity or other regulatory sanctions. Insurance Regulation Our businesses, subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to a wide variety of insurance and insurance holding company system laws and regulations in both the United States and numerous other jurisdictions, including the European Union, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Cayman Islands, Canada and Malaysia. United States Within the United States, each states insurance laws require each of our insurance company subsidiaries to be licensed and regulated by the commissioner, superintendent or director of the insurance department (each, a Commissioner) of its domiciliary state and each state in which it transacts insurance as an admitted insurer. As the ultimate controlling entity, we are subject to the insurance holding company system laws of the domiciliary state of each insurance company subsidiary, which requires, among other filings, its annual registration statement filing with the Commissioner of its domiciliary state and the submission of our financial information and other information about the operations of companies within its holding company system, including submission of an annual enterprise risk report identifying material risks within the holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to our insurance company subsidiaries. These laws also impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of an insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends and make other distributions to its parent company. In addition, transactions between an insurance company and other companies within its holding company system, including sales, loans, investments, reinsurance agreements, tax allocation agreements, management agreements and service agreements, must be on terms that are fair and reasonable and, if material or within a specified category, require prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval by the applicable domiciliary state Commissioner. State Commissioners have broad administrative powers over the insurance business of our insurance company subsidiaries, including: (1) licensing to transact business; (2) licensing of producers who sell our products; (3) prescribing which assets and liabilities are to be considered in determining statutory surplus; (4) regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; (5) approving policy forms and certain related materials; (6) determining whether a reasonable basis exists as to the suitability of the annuity purchase recommendations producers make and, in certain states, that such recommendations are in the best interest of the consumer; (7) regulating unfair trade and claims practices; (8) establishing reserve requirements, solvency standards and minimum capital requirements; (9) regulating the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year; (10) regulating the 27 Table of Contents availability of reinsurance, the terms thereof and the ability of an insurer to take credit on its financial statements for insurance ceded to reinsurers; (11) fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans, minimum crediting rates on accumulation products and minimum allowable surrender values; (12) regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted; (13) setting parameters for transactions with affiliates; and (14) regulating certain other matters. All states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer, which would include a change of control of its holding company. Such laws prevent any person from acquiring direct or indirect control of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or their holding companies unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the Commissioner and has obtained the Commissioners prior approval. Under such state statutes, generally acquiring 10% or more of a voting interest in an insurer or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of a voting interest in a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the applicable state will be in violation of the applicable states law and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the Commissioner or prohibiting the voting of those securities and/or to other actions determined by the Commissioner. Further, a willful violation of these laws is punishable in each state as a criminal offense. In addition, state insurance holding company system laws require any controlling person of a U.S. insurer seeking to divest its controlling interest in the insurer to file with the relevant Commissioner a confidential notice of the proposed divestiture at least thirty days prior to the cessation of control (unless a person acquiring control from the divesting party has filed notice of the proposed acquisition of control with the Commissioner). After receipt of the notice, the Commissioner must determine whether the parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest will be required to file for or obtain approval of the transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (in particular through an unsolicited transaction), even if the stockholders of such parent consider such transaction to be desirable. All 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring insurance companies doing business within those jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations. Guaranty associations are organized to cover, subject to limits, contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies which later become impaired or insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on each member insurer doing business in a particular state on the basis of their proportionate share of the premiums written by all member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer previously engaged. Most states limit assessments in any year to 2% of the insurers average annual premium for the three years preceding the calendar year in which the impaired insurer became impaired or insolvent. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years. Assessments levied against Athenes U.S. insurance subsidiaries by guaranty associations during the year ended December 31, 2023 were not material. While we cannot accurately predict the amount of any such future assessments, or past or future insolvencies of competitors which would lead to such assessments, it is possible that any such assessments with respect to pending insurers impairments and insolvencies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, and any reserves we have previously established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. Other Jurisdictions The operations of our insurance subsidiaries and branches operating outside the United States are subject to the local regulatory and supervisory schemes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which vary widely from country to country; however, regulators typically grant licenses to operate and control an insurance business in a specific jurisdiction. In general, insurance regulators in most jurisdictions have the administrative power to supervise the registration of agents, regulation of product features and product approvals, asset allocation, minimum capital requirements, solvency and reserves, policyholder liabilities, and investments. Regulatory authorities may also regulate affiliations with other financial institutions, stockholder structures and may impose restrictions on declaring dividends and the ability to effect certain capital transactions, and many jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in policyholder protection schemes. Many of the insurance regulatory frameworks that govern our and our affiliated funds insurance entities operating outside the United States require the prior consent of the applicable regulator in such jurisdictions before (i) any person can become a controller/qualifying holder or acquire a direct or indirect qualifying holding ( e.g. , 10%, 20%, 30% or 33% and 50%) in any regulated company, or over the parent undertaking of any such regulated company or (ii) any increase of an existing holding that would result in a person reaching the applicable thresholds of the jurisdiction ( e.g. , 10%, 20%, 30% or 33% and 28 Table of Contents 50%). In addition, certain regulators require the insurance entities or their qualifying holders to notify the appropriate regulator of any prospective changes in organizational structure of which they are aware, sometimes regardless of whether the controller/qualifying holder or the proposed controller/qualifying holder would be required to submit a change in control application or an application to acquire a qualifying holding as a result of such changes in organizational structure. Breach of the requirements to notify the relevant regulator of a decision to acquire or increase control/holding, or of the requirement to obtain approval before completing the relevant control/qualifying holding transaction may in some jurisdictions be a criminal offense attracting potentially unlimited fines. Regulators can also seek other remedies, including suspension of voting rights in the relevant insurance undertaking or having the purported acquisition annulled. In particular, the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA), which regulates Athene, Athora and Catalina (as defined below), maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. For these purposes, a controller includes (1) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company, (3) a stockholder controller, and (4) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or its parent company are accustomed to act. The definition of stockholder controller is set out in the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the Bermuda Insurance Act) and generally refers to (1) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a stockholders meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any stockholders meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company or (3) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any stockholders meeting. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, stockholder controller ownership is defined as follows: Actual Stockholder Controller Voting Power Defined Stockholder Controller Voting Power 10% or more but less than 20% 10% 20% or more but less than 33% 20% 33% or more but less than 50% 33% 50% or more 50% Where the shares of a registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognized stock exchange, and such stockholder becomes a 10%, 20%, 33%, or 50% stockholder controller of the insurer, that stockholder shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that such stockholder has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a controller of any such category. Any person or entity who contravenes the Bermuda Insurance Act by failing to give notice or knowingly becoming a controller of any description before the required 45 days has elapsed is guilty of an offense under Bermuda law and liable to a fine of $25,000 on summary conviction. The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person or entity who has become a controller of any category when it appears that such person or entity is not, or is no longer, fit and proper to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person or entity concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMAs intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person or entity served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. Any person or entity who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection is guilty of an offense and liable on summary conviction to a fine of $25,000 (and a continuing fine of $500 per day for each day that the offense is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of $100,000 and/or 2 years in prison. The Bermuda Insurance Act regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under such act by the BMA. The BMA is required by the Bermuda Insurance Act to determine whether an applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. The continued registration of an insurer is subject to the insurer complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Bermuda Insurance Act also grants to 29 Table of Contents the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurers. The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurers solvency standards, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. During the course of 2023, the BMA issued consultation papers, and received feedback from stakeholders, on certain proposed enhancements to Bermudas regulatory regime for commercial insurers. The enhancements are aimed at ensuring that the regime continues to remain fit for purpose, in line with international standards and keeps pace with market developments. In addition to potential enhancements to technical provisions and computation of the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement, the BMA is seeking to strengthen supervisory cooperation and exchange of information and increased publication of regulatory information to further develop good governance and risk management practices, transparency, and market discipline. As of the end of 2023, draft rules and guidance notes were published for each commercial insurer class and insurance groups with the new requirements expected to come into force on March 31, 2024. In the U.K., Apollo is considered the controller of certain insurance company (or equivalent) subsidiaries of Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd. (Catalina) and Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (Aspen), including Catalina Worthing Insurance Limited, AGF Insurance Limited, Aspen Insurance UK Limited (Aspen U.K.), which is domiciled in the United Kingdom and operates regulated branches in Australia, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, and Aspen Managing Agency Limited, the Lloyds managing agent of Syndicate 4711, which has its underwriting capacity provided by Aspens subsidiary Aspen Underwriting Limited, a Lloyds corporate member. In addition, Catalina Services UK Limited and Aspen U.K. Syndicate Services Limited are also domiciled in the United Kingdom and provide insurance distribution services for purposes of certain U.K. insurance regulations. In Ireland, Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Ireland plc, which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Athora Life Re Ltd. An indirect qualifying holding in Athora Ireland Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Athora, is also attributed to Apollo via Apollos indirect interest in Athora. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Deutschland Verwaltungs GmbH, Athora Deutschland Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Athora Deutschland GmbH, Athora Lebensversicherung AG and Athora Pensionskasse AG, which are either German regulated insurance undertakings or German insurance holding companies. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Belgium S.A./N.V. (Athora Belgium), which is a Belgian licensed insurance and reinsurance undertaking. In addition, some of Athora Belgiums subsidiaries are registered with the Belgian regulator as insurance brokers and are subject to supervision by the Belgian regulator as regards their insurance distribution activities. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Netherlands N.V. (formerly known as: VIVAT N.V.), Proteq Levensverzekeringen N.V., and SRLEV N.V., which are either Dutch regulated insurance undertakings or a Dutch insurance holding company, and Zwitserleven PPI N.V. and Stichting Lifesight, which are Dutch premium pension institutions. Apollo holds an indirect stake in Challenger Life Company Limited (Challenger), which is an Australian regulated life insurance company, Challenger Bank Limited, an Australian regulated authorized deposit-taking institution, and Challenger Retirement and Investment Services Limited, a superannuation entity and trustee for the Challenger Retirement Fund, an Australian regulated superannuation fund, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Challenger Limited, an Australian listed company. Challenger Limited also has certain regulated subsidiaries outside of Australia. Aspen also carries on insurance business through its Singapore Lloyds service company. Additionally, Catalina carries on insurance business through its Singapore-domiciled subsidiary Asia Capital Reinsurance Group Pte. Ltd., which in turn operates through its subsidiaries in Malaysia. Regulation of an Insurance Group Many insurers, including certain of our subsidiaries, operate within a group structure with two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. U.S. state and international regulators have developed group supervisory frameworks in order to provide regulators with the ability to scrutinize the activities of an insurance group and assess its potential impact on individual insurers within the group. A group supervisor may perform a number of supervisory functions, including: (1) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information in both the ordinary course and emergency situations, including the 30 Table of Contents dissemination of information that is of importance for the supervisory activities of other competent authorities; (2) carrying out supervisory reviews and assessments of the insurance group; (3) carrying out assessments of the insurance groups compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (4) planning and coordinating supervisory activities in respect of the insurance group, in both the ordinary course and in emergency situations through regular meetings held at least annually (or by other appropriate means) with other competent authorities; (5) coordinating enforcement actions that may need to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members; and (6) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors (consisting of insurance regulators) in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above. The group supervisor may impose certain requirements on the insurance group, including to make provision for, among other things: (1) assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and/or its members and (2) regulating intra-group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure. Many of these requirements have not yet been applied in substance to us or our affiliates or, to the extent they have been applied, remain subject to modification as part of larger prudential regulatory initiatives. Government agencies and insurance standard setters in the U.S. and worldwide have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial activities and systems in general, as indicated by the development of the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame), as adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). ComFrame is applicable to entities that meet the IAIS criteria for internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) and that are so designated by their group-wide supervisor and includes a group capital requirement in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements and any group capital requirements imposed by relevant insurance laws and regulations. On February 6, 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division (the IID) identified Apollo as meeting the criteria as an IAIG and further identified Athene as the Head of the IAIG. In general, the Head of the IAIG is the uppermost entity to which obligations associated with an IAIG designation attach. As a result of these identifications, we expect Athene to be subject to the relevant capital standard that the U.S. applies to IAIGs. The IID further identified itself as the Group-Wide Supervisor for Apollo (in a distinct capacity from its role as supervisor for Athene). Iowa has been effectively serving in this role for a significant period of time; this identification is a formal recognition of the IIDs existing supervisory relationship to Apollo. At this time, we do not expect a significant impact on Athenes capital position or capital structure; however, we cannot fully predict with certainty the impact (if any) on Athenes capital position or capital structure and any other burdens being named an IAIG may impose on Athene or its insurance affiliates. Capital Requirements Each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is subject to regulatory capital requirements based upon the laws and regulations of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Regulators of each jurisdiction in which we operate have discretionary authority in connection with our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries continued licensing to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders within their respective jurisdiction or to restrict continued operation of insurers or reinsurers domiciled in their respective jurisdiction if, in their judgment, such entities have not maintained the required level of minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business would be hazardous to policyholders or reinsurance counterparties. Restrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Any proposed dividend in excess of the amount permitted by law is considered an extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution and may not be paid until it has been approved, or generally a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the Commissioner. In addition, entities that are regulated insurers are strictly prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends unless certain financial conditions are met or prior approval from the BMA is received. Consumer Protection Laws and Privacy and Data Security Regulation Federal and state consumer protection laws affect our operations. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 implemented fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the United States and includes privacy requirements for financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the re-disclosure and re-use of such information. 31 Table of Contents In addition to federal and other financial institution-specific privacy laws and regulations, an increasing number of states are considering and passing comprehensive privacy legislation. The issues surrounding data security and the safeguarding of consumers protected information are under increasing regulatory scrutiny by state and federal regulators. Regulated Entities Outside of the U.S. Certain of our subsidiaries and the funds that we manage that operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States are licensed by or have obtained authorizations to operate in their respective jurisdictions outside of the United States, and as a result are regulated by various international regulators and subject to applicable regulation. These registrations, licenses or authorizations relate to providing investment advice, discretionary investment management, arranging deals, marketing securities, capital markets activities and other regulated activities. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing these subsidiaries that have been registered, licensed or authorized could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Outside of the U.S., our subsidiaries and the funds that we manage, including Apollo Management International LLP, Apollo Credit Management International Limited, Apollo Asset Management Europe LLP, Apollo Asset Management Europe PC LLP, Apollo Investment Management Europe LLP, Apollo Investment Management Europe (Luxembourg) S.à r.l., Apollo Capital Solutions Europe B.V., Apollo Advisors (Mauritius) Ltd, AION Capital Management Limited, Apollo Management Singapore Pte. Ltd., Apollo Management Singapore Pte. Ltd., Apollo Management Asia Pacific Limited, Apollo Management Japan Limited, PK AirFinance Japan Godo Kaisha and PK AIR 1 JPN Godo Kaisha, are subject to regulation in the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Mauritius, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. Other Regulatory Considerations . Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is important to our culture. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures, such as our code of ethics, compliance systems, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. We have a compliance group that monitors our compliance with the regulatory requirements to which we are subject and manages our compliance policies and procedures. Our Chief Compliance Officer supervises our compliance group, which is responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance risks such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering (including know-your-customer controls), valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, document retention, potential conflicts of interest and the allocation of investment opportunities. We generally operate without information barriers between our asset management businesses. In an effort to manage possible risks resulting from our decision not to implement these barriers, our compliance personnel maintain a list of issuers for which we have access to material, non-public information and whose securities our funds and investment professionals are not permitted to trade. We could in the future decide that it is advisable to establish information barriers, particularly as our business expands and diversifies. In such event our ability to operate as an integrated platform will be restricted.

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

.com. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Macroeconomic Risks Difficult political, market or economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the political environment and financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world, such as changes in interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), governmental policy and regulatory reform, changes in trade policy, tariffs and trade sanctions on goods, trade wars, U.S.-China relations, the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU single market and customs union, imposition or maintenance of trade barriers, labor shortages, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, supply chain disruptions, economic, political, fiscal and/or other developments in or affecting Eurozone countries, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, wars, other national and international political circumstances (including terrorist acts or security operations), natural disasters, climate change, pandemics or other severe public health crises and other events outside of our control. Both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2023 and inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which we operate, may continue at elevated levels for the near term. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and central banks in various other countries have raised, and may again raise interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. Interest rate risk poses a significant market risk to us as a result of interest rate-sensitive assets ( e.g. , fixed income assets) and liabilities ( e.g. , fixed deferred and immediate annuities) held by us and by the portfolio companies of the funds we manage. Certain portfolio companies of the funds we manage may also be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and their ability to pay interest and principal on their loans, particularly if interest rates rise further in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in such portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our and our funds investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations. The conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East have increased global economic and political uncertainty. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., U.K., and EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia, and additional controls and sanctions could be enacted in the future. We are continuing to actively monitor the situations in Russia, Ukraine and Israel and assess their impact on our business and the business and operations of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage (particularly the impact on portfolio companies that operate in industries such as chemicals, oil and gas and aviation). We have no significant exposure to Russia, Ukraine or Israel and as such, to date, these conflicts have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that these conflicts may escalate or expand, and the scope, extent and duration of the military action, current or future sanctions and resulting market and geopolitical disruptions could be significant. Any acceleration of a global energy crisis, including as a result of restrictions on Russia's energy exports or the expansion of the Middle East conflicts, could similarly have an adverse impact on certain of the geographies where we do business and certain business and operations of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage. We cannot predict the impact these conflicts may have on the global economy or our business, financial condition and operations in the future. These conflicts may also heighten the impact of other risks described herein. Additionally, investing in securities of issuers organized or based outside the U.S. and operating outside the U.S. may also expose us to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. These factors are outside our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions. 33 Table of Contents Volatility caused by political, market or economic conditions can materially hinder the initiation of new, large-sized transactions for funds in our asset management business and, together with volatility in valuations of equity and debt securities, may adversely impact our operating results. It may also increase the risk that cash flows generated from our operations or the collateral underlying the structured products we own may differ from our expectations in timing or amount. In addition, many of our classes of investments, but in particular our alternative investments, may produce investment income that fluctuates significantly from period to period. Any event reducing the estimated fair value of these securities, other than on a temporary basis, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Volatility and general economic trends are also likely to impact the performance of portfolio companies in many industries, particularly industries that are more affected by changes in consumer demand, such as the packaging, manufacturing, chemical and refining industries, as well as the travel and leisure, gaming and real estate industries. Our performance, and the performance of the funds we manage, may be adversely affected to the extent portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends. There is also a risk of both sector-specific and broad-based corrections and/or downturns in the equity and/or credit markets. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs, within a time frame sufficient to match any further decreases in net income or increases in net losses relating to changes in market and economic conditions. Moreover, our retirement services business is materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally, as well as by the global economy. Actual or perceived stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in financial asset classes or various capital and credit markets can have an adverse effect on our retirement services business, both because such conditions may decrease the returns on, and value of, its investment portfolio and because its benefit and claim liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. In times of economic hardship, the policyholders of our retirement services business may choose to defer paying insurance premiums, stop paying insurance premiums altogether or surrender their policies. In addition, actual or perceived difficult conditions in the capital markets may discourage individuals from making investment decisions and purchasing our retirement services products. Climate change-related risks and regulatory and other efforts to address climate change could adversely affect our business. We and the portfolio companies of the funds we manage face a number of risks associated with climate change, including both transition and physical risks. The transition risks that could impact us and the investments of the funds we manage include those risks related to the impact of U.S. and foreign climate-related legislation and regulation, as well as risks arising from climate-related business trends. Moreover, our investments, and the investments of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, are subject to risks stemming from the physical impacts of climate change. In particular, climate change may impact asset prices and the value of investments linked to real estate. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real estate values in coastal areas. We and the funds we manage have significant concentrations of real estate investments and collateral underlying investments linked to real estate in areas of the United States prone to severe weather and climate events, including California, sections of the northeastern U.S., the South Atlantic states and the Gulf Coast. Climate change-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws have resulted, and may continue to result, in enhanced disclosure obligations that could negatively affect us or the investments of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage and also materially increase our regulatory burden. We also face business trend-related climate risks. Certain fund investors are increasingly taking climate-related risks into account when determining whether to invest in the funds we manage. Our reputation and investor relationships could be damaged as a result of our involvement, or the involvement of the funds we manage, in certain industries, portfolio companies or transactions associated with activities perceived to be causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. We are subject to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. We are subject to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such public health crises could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including by adversely impacting the valuations of the investments made by our asset management and retirement services businesses, which are generally correlated to the performance of the relevant equity and debt markets; increasing volatility in the financial markets; preventing us from capitalizing on certain market opportunities; causing prolonged asset price inflation and hampering our asset management business ability to deploy capital or to deploy capital as profitably; interrupting global or regional supply chains; hurting consumer confidence and economic activity; reducing opportunities for our asset management business to successfully exit existing investments; straining our liquidity, which may impact our credit ratings and limit the availability 34 Table of Contents of future financing; impairing our asset management business equity investments and impacting the ability of the portfolio companies of our asset management business to meet their respective financial obligations and comply with existing covenants; increasing the rate at which policyholders of our insurance products withdraw their policies; and reducing our ability to understand and foresee trends and changes in the markets in which we operate. Operating Risks A portion of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is highly variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis, which may cause the price of our shares to be volatile. A portion of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is highly variable, primarily due to the fact that performance fees from our asset management business and the transaction, advisory and other fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition, the investment returns of most of the funds we manage are volatile. We may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of investments of the funds we manage, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, policyholder behavior, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Our future results will also be significantly dependent on the success of the larger funds we manage ( e.g. , Fund VIII, Fund IX and Fund X), changes in the value of which may result in fluctuations in our results. In addition, performance fees from some of the funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner if, upon the final distribution, the relevant funds general partner has received cumulative performance fees on individual portfolio investments in excess of the amount of performance fees it would be entitled to from the profits calculated for all portfolio investments in the aggregate. Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of our shares and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period. It may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in earnings and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the price of our shares or increased volatility in the price of our shares in general. The timing of performance fees generated by the funds we manage is uncertain and will contribute to the volatility of our results. Performance fees depend on the performance of the funds we manage. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. Generally, if the funds we manage were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. With respect to a number of credit funds, our performance fees are generally paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and the varying frequency of these payments will contribute to the volatility of our revenues and cash flow. Furthermore, we earn these performance fees only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular threshold, which is referred to as a high water mark. Such performance fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of investors investments in the fund, which could lead to significant volatility in our results. We may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies, markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses. We actively consider the opportunistic expansion of our businesses, both geographically and into new investment strategies and platforms, and intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to grow our businesses by increasing AUM in existing businesses and expanding into new investment strategies, platforms, geographic markets, businesses and distribution channels, including the retail channel. We intend to grow our business in the future in part by acquisitions and joint ventures, each of which could require additional cash and equity, systems development and skilled personnel. We may experience challenges identifying, financing, consummating and integrating such acquisitions and transactions. Our organizational documents do not limit us to the asset management and retirement services businesses. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, including entering into new lines of business. We may not be successful in any such attempted expansion. Attempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special risks, including the diversion of managements attention from our core businesses; the disruption of our ongoing businesses; entry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience; increasing demands on our operational systems and infrastructure; potential increase in investor concentration; enhanced regulatory scrutiny and greater reputational 35 Table of Contents and litigation risk; difficulty in combining or integrating operational and management systems; and the broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions (including regulatory, tax, legal and reputational consequences). Additionally, any expansion of our businesses could result in significant increases in our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements, which would increase the risks of investing in our shares, and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We also may not be successful in identifying new investment strategies or geographic markets that increase our profitability, or in identifying and acquiring new businesses that increase our profitability. We have also entered into strategic partnerships, separately managed accounts and sub-advisory arrangements, which lack the scale of the funds we traditionally manage and are more costly to administer. The prevalence of these accounts may also present conflicts and introduce complexity in the deployment of capital. Before expanding into new investment strategies, or making any fund investments generally, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex issues, including but not limited to those related to business, financial, credit risk, tax, accounting, environmental, legal and regulatory and macroeconomic trends. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) or risks that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity, including past or current violations of law and related legal exposure, and we may not identify or foresee future developments that could have a material adverse effect on an investment ( e.g. , technological disruption across an industry). We have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of products offered to individual investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk. We have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of products, including externally managed vehicles, offered to investors, especially individual (non-institutional) investors (including investors often described as high net worth individuals, family offices and mass affluent individuals), in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world. Our investment adviser subsidiaries or affiliates currently externally manage or advise a number of such vehicles, and a number of other vehicles are expected to be launched at various times in the future. In some cases, the offerings are distributed to such investors indirectly through third-party managed vehicles sponsored by brokerage firms, private banks or other third parties, and in other cases directly to the qualified clients of private banks, independent investment advisors and brokers. In other cases, we create products specifically designed for direct investment by individual investors in the U.S., some of whom are not accredited investors, or similar investors in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including in Europe and Asia. Such products are regulated by the SEC in the U.S. and by other similar regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. Accessing individual investors and selling products directed at such investors exposes us to new and greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement risks. To the extent we distribute products through new channels, including through unaffiliated third-party firms, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in litigation or regulatory action against us, including with respect to, among other things, claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or that they are distributed in an otherwise inappropriate manner. Although we seek to ensure through due diligence and onboarding procedures that the third parties through which individual investors access our products conduct themselves responsibly, we are exposed to the risks of reputational damage and legal liability to the extent such third parties improperly sell our products to investors. Similarly, there is a risk that Apollo employees involved in the direct distribution of our products, or employees who oversee independent advisors, brokerage firms and other third parties around the world involved in distributing our products, do not follow our compliance and supervisory procedures. In addition, the distribution of products, including through new channels, whether directly or through market intermediaries, could expose us to allegations of improper conduct and/or actions by state and federal regulators in the U.S. and regulators in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. with respect to, among other things, product suitability, investor classification, compliance with securities laws, conflicts of interest and the adequacy of disclosure to customers to whom our products are distributed through those channels. In addition, many of the products that we make available to individual investors contain terms that permit such investors to request redemption or repurchase of their interests on a periodic basis and, subject to certain limitations, include limits on the aggregate amount of such interests that may be redeemed or repurchased in a given period. Challenging market or economic conditions and liquidity needs could cause elevated share redemption or repurchase requests from investors in such products. In 36 Table of Contents addition, limitations can be placed on the amount of redemptions or repurchases that are fulfilled. Such limitations are particularly possible in the event redemption or repurchase requests are elevated or investor subscriptions to such products are concurrently at reduced levels. Such limitations may subject us to reputational harm and may make such vehicles less attractive to individual investors, which could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows of such vehicles. This may in turn negatively impact the revenues we derive from such vehicles. As we expand the distribution of products to individual investors outside of the U.S., we are increasingly exposed to risks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. While many of the risks we face in non-U.S. jurisdictions are similar to those that we face in the distribution of products to individual investors in the U.S., securities laws and other applicable regulatory regimes can be extensive, complex and vary by jurisdiction. In addition, the distribution of products to individual investors outside of the U.S. may involve complex structures and market practices that vary by local jurisdiction. As a result, this expansion subjects us to additional complexity, litigation and regulatory risk. In addition, our initiatives to expand our individual investor base, including outside of the U.S., requires the investment of significant time, effort and resources, including the potential hiring of additional personnel, the implementation of new operational, compliance and other systems and processes and the development or implementation of new technology. There is no assurance that such efforts will be successful. We operate in highly competitive industries, which could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategies and could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We operate in highly competitive markets and compete with a large number of investment management firms, private equity, credit and real assets fund sponsors, U.S. and non-U.S. insurance and reinsurance companies, broker-dealers, financial advisors, asset managers and other financial institutions. In particular, our asset management business faces intense competition in the pursuit of outside investors for the funds we manage, and our retirement services business faces intense competition with respect to both the products it offers and the acquisition and block reinsurance transactions it pursues. These competitive pressures may have a material and adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We depend on certain key personnel and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on us. The success of our businesses depends on the efforts, judgment, business relationships, personal reputations and continued service of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or damage to their personal reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, our retention of our key personnel and our success in recruiting additional personnel is crucial to our success. If our key personnel were to join or form a competitor, our business could similarly suffer a material adverse effect. For example, some of the investors in the funds we manage could choose to invest with that competitor, another competitor or not at all, rather than in the funds we manage. We do not carry any key man insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key personnel. We may also not succeed in recruiting additional personnel because the market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive. Efforts to retain or attract key personnel may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, the governing agreements of certain of the funds we manage provide that in the event certain investment professionals and other key personnel fail to devote the requisite time to our businesses, the commitment period will terminate. In some instances, such termination becomes effective only if coupled with a certain percentage in interest of the fund investors or the respective fund advisory board not voting to continue the commitment period. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of the funds we manage would likely result in significant reputational damage to us. Misconduct by our current and former employees, directors, advisers, third party-service providers or others affiliated with us could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. There is a risk that our employees, directors, advisers, third party-service providers or others affiliated with us could engage, deliberately or recklessly, in misconduct or fraud that creates legal exposure for us and adversely affects our businesses. With respect to our retirement services business, our insurance businesses rely on third-party intermediaries to sell our products and services and we further rely on third-party administrators to administer a portion of our annuity contracts as well as legacy life insurance business. If anyone associated or affiliated with us, or the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, were to 37 Table of Contents engage, or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities, sexual harassment, racial or gender discrimination, improper use or disclosure of confidential information, fraud, payment or solicitation of bribes, misrepresentation of products and services or any other type of similar misconduct or violation of other laws and regulations, we could suffer serious harm to our brand, reputation, be subject to penalties or sanctions, face difficulties in raising funds, suffer serious harm to our financial position and current and future business relationships, as well as face potentially significant litigation or investigations. Fraud, payment or solicitation of bribes and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at the portfolio companies of the funds we manage could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our performance. There are a number of grounds upon which such misconduct at a portfolio company could subject us to criminal and/or civil liability, including on the basis of actual knowledge, willful blindness, or control person liability. We rely on technology and information systems, many of which are controlled by third-party vendors, to maintain the security of our information and technology networks and to conduct our businesses, and any failures or interruptions of these systems could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. We are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store a range of data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our employees, our investors, our retirement services business policyholders and other third parties, in our data centers and on our networks and we rely on technology and information systems to execute, confirm and settle transactions. We rely on a host of information systems and hardware systems for the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information, and the unavailability of these systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our businesses and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our businesses and results of operations to suffer. Although we are not currently aware of any cyberattacks or other incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have materially affected, or would reasonably be expected to materially affect, our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that the various procedures and controls we utilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems, especially because the cyberattack techniques used change frequently and are not recognized until launched, the full scope of a cyberattack may not be realized until an investigation has been performed and cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to strengthen our computer systems, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective. Furthermore, delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of our information systems could adversely impact their effectiveness or could expose us, as well as our clients and others who rely upon, or have exposure to, our systems, to security and other risks. We are also dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors that we do not control for hosting the information systems and hardware systems that are critical to our businesses. We also rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our businesses, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of the funds we manage and compliance matters. While we require our critical third-party suppliers to implement and maintain what we believe to be effective cybersecurity and data protection measures, we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, which has happened in the past, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. A disaster, disruption or compromise in technology or infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us, our vendors or third parties with whom we conduct business, may have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption which could have a material adverse effect on us. These risks could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services rather than software services that can be operated within our own data centers. These risks also increase to the extent we engage in operations outside the U.S. We also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, costs related to data security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. 38 Table of Contents As new technologies, including tools that harness generative artificial intelligence and other machine learning techniques, rapidly develop and become accessible, the use of such new technologies by us, our affiliates and our third party service providers will present additional known and unknown risks, including, among others, the risk that confidential information may be stolen, misappropriated or disclosed and the risk that we and/or third party service providers may rely on incorrect, unclear or biased outputs generated by such technologies, any of which could have an adverse impact on us and our business. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent, unauthorized or accidental use or misuse of investor, policyholder, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation and regulatory actions against us by the U.S. federal and state governments, the EU or other jurisdictions, various regulatory organizations or exchanges, or affected individuals, in addition to significant reputational harm. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows depend on the accuracy of our managements assumptions and estimates, and we could experience significant gains or losses if these assumptions and estimates differ significantly from actual results. We make and rely on certain assumptions and estimates regarding many matters related to our businesses, including valuations, interest rates, investment returns, expenses and operating costs, tax assets and liabilities, tax rates, business mix, surrender activity, mortality and contingent liabilities. We also use these assumptions and estimates to make decisions crucial to our business operations. We also use assumptions and estimates to make decisions about pricing, target returns and expense structures for our insurance subsidiaries products and pension group annuity transactions; determining the amount of reserves our retirement services business is required to hold for its policy liabilities; determining the price our retirement services business will pay to acquire or reinsure business; determining the hedging strategies we employ to manage risks to our business and operations; and determining the amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support their businesses. Similarly, our management teams make similar assumptions and estimates in planning and measuring the performance of our asset management business. In addition, certain investments and other assets and liabilities of our asset management business and our retirement services business must be, or at our election are, measured at fair value the determination of which involves the use of various assumptions and estimates and considerable judgment. The factors influencing these various assumptions and estimates cannot be calculated or predicted with certainty, and if our assumptions and estimates differ significantly from actual outcomes and results, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. Many of the funds we manage invest in illiquid assets and many of the investments of our retirement services business are relatively illiquid and we may fail to realize profits from these assets for a considerable period of time, or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these assets if we are required to sell our invested assets at a loss at inopportune times or in response to changes in applicable rules and regulations. Many of the funds we manage invest in securities or other financial instruments that are not publicly traded or are otherwise viewed as illiquid. In many cases, the funds we manage may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. The ability of many funds, particularly the private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets. Furthermore, large holdings even of publicly traded securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the disposition period. Accordingly, the funds we manage may be forced, under certain conditions, to sell securities at a loss. In addition, many investments by our retirement services business are in securities that are not publicly traded or that otherwise lack liquidity, such as its privately placed fixed maturity securities, below investment grade securities, investments in mortgage loans and alternative investments. These relatively illiquid types of investments are recorded at fair value. If a material liquidity demand is triggered and we are unable to satisfy the demand with the sources of liquidity available to us, our retirement services business could be forced to sell certain of its assets and there can be no assurance that it would be able to sell them for the values at which such assets are recorded and it might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices. In many cases, our retirement services business may also be prohibited by contract or applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Thus, it may be impossible or costly to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet unexpected withdrawal or recapture obligations. This potential mismatch between the liquidity of assets and liabilities could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Further, governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives, and may promulgate new or revised, or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing, rules and regulations at any time that may impact our investments. Such changes in regulatory requirements could disrupt market liquidity, make it more difficult for us to source and invest in attractive private investments, and cause securities that are not publicly traded to lose value, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on the financing markets for the operation of our business. We rely on the debt and equity financing markets for the operation of our business. To the extent that debt and equity markets render financing difficult to obtain, refinance or extend, or more expensive, this may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, the ability of the funds we manage, particularly private equity funds, to exit investments on favorable terms or at all is heavily dependent on the condition of the equity markets. Many of the funds we manage utilize subscription lines of credit to fund operations and investments, including their equity contributions in a portfolio company. Some of these are also intended as a source of longer-term borrowings for investments by the relevant funds. In other cases, some funds make investments through the use of net asset value-based fund finance facilities or similar financing arrangements, margin loans or other derivative financing arrangements that are backed by the funds investment portfolio. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such indebtedness may not be recovered by appreciation in the assets purchased or carried, and will be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated in the event of a decline in the market value of such assets. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the funds net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the funds net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. The inability to obtain such financing on attractive terms may impact the ability of the funds we manage to achieve targeted rates of return. Additionally, certain investments by the funds we manage rely heavily on the use of leverage. The absence of available sources of senior debt financing for extended periods of time could materially and adversely affect the funds we manage. In the event that funds we manage are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential investments, including acquisitions, or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or otherwise on unfavorable terms, such funds may be forced to find alternative sources of financing (including equity), may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable investments or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, any of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. Any failure by lenders to provide previously committed financing can also expose us to potential claims by counterparties with which funds we manage have contracted to effectuate an investment transaction ( i.e. , sellers of businesses that funds we manage may have contracted to purchase). In addition, to the extent that the current markets make it difficult or impossible for a portfolio company to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, it may face substantial doubt as to its status as a going concern (which may result in an event of default under various agreements) or it may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Furthermore, investments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. As a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. In addition, our retirement services business relies on access to lending and debt markets to provide capital and liquidity. Changes in debt financing markets may impact our retirement services business access to capital and liquidity. Calculations of required insurance capital may move with market movements and result in greater capital needs during economic downturns. Our retirement services business may also need additional liquidity to pay insurance liabilities in excess of its assumptions due to market impacts on policyholder behavior. Risks Relating to Our Asset Management Business We may experience a decline in revenue from our asset management business. In our asset management business, we derive revenues from:  capital committed to the funds, invested by the funds, or the net asset value of the funds;  management fees, which are based generally on the amount of capital committed or invested in the funds we manage; 40 Table of Contents  in connection with services relating to investments by the funds we manage, fees earned or otherwise collected by one or more service providers affiliated with us;  performance fees, based on the performance of the funds we manage; and  investment income from our investments, including as general partner. If a fund we manage performs poorly, we will receive little or no performance fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from any principal investment in the fund. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later investments in a funds life, the fund does not achieve total investment returns that exceed a specified investment return threshold for the life of the fund, we could be obligated to repay the amount by which performance fees that were previously distributed to us exceeds amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. Several of the funds we manage may go into clawback. There can be no assurance that we will not incur a clawback repayment obligation in the future. A variety of fees that we earn, such as origination, syndication, arranger, placement, sourcing, structuring and other similar financing-related fees, are driven in part by the pace at which the funds we manage commit to make or make investments. Any decline in the pace at which the funds we manage make investments would reduce our origination, syndication, arranger, structuring and other similar financing-related fees and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Likewise, any increase in the pace at which the funds we manage exit investments would reduce origination, syndication, arranger, structuring and other similar financing-related fees. In addition, we will experience a decrease in the amount of fee revenue if we share with fund investors a larger portion, or all, of certain types of fees generated by funds investments, such as management consulting fees and merger and acquisition transaction advisory fees, or if expenses arising from the operation of the funds we manage are borne by us alone, rather than the funds. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries perform underwriting, syndicating and securities placement services for the funds we manage and their portfolio companies, for investments made by our retirement services business and for third parties. Our ability to maintain or grow these services, and the related fees we earn therefrom, depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control, including conditions in the debt or equity markets. The Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain current and former investment professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, general partner clawback obligations, and we have agreed to indemnify them for such amounts attributed to interests they previously contributed or sold to the Apollo Operating Group. In each instance, a decrease in the fees we receive from the funds we manage and other operating activities, will lead to a decrease in our revenues and may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We depend on investors in the funds we manage for the continued success of our asset management business. It could become increasingly difficult for the funds we manage to raise capital as funds compete for investments from a limited number of qualified investors. Without the participation of investors, the funds we manage will not be successful in consummating their capital-raising efforts, or they may consummate them at investment levels lower than those currently anticipated. Certain institutional investors have publicly criticized compensation arrangements, including management, transaction and advisory fees. Although we have no obligation to modify any fees or other terms with respect to the funds we manage, we experience pressure to do so. In addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, continue to demonstrate an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as managed accounts, specialized funds and co-investment vehicles. Even though we have entered into such strategic arrangements, there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable to us as traditional investment fund structures. While we have historically competed primarily on the performance of the funds we manage, and not on the level of our management fees or performance fees relative to those of our competitors, there is a risk that management fees and performance fees in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Management fee or performance fee reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure even if other revenue streams increase, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The failure of the funds we manage to raise capital in sufficient amounts and on satisfactory terms could result in a decrease in AUM, performance fees and/or fee revenue or could result in us being unable to achieve an increase in AUM, performance fees and/or fee revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any 41 Table of Contents modification of our existing fee arrangements or the fee structures for new funds could adversely affect our results of operations. We continue to depend on investors in the funds we manage even after the capital-raising phase of any fund. Investors in many of the funds we manage make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. If investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the governing documents of substantially all of the funds we manage in which there are third party investors provide that a simple majority-in-interest of a funds unaffiliated investors have the right to liquidate that fund for any or no reason, which would cause management fees and performance fees to terminate. We do not know whether, and under what circumstances, the investors in the funds we manage are likely to exercise such right. Furthermore, the management agreements of the funds we manage would also terminate if we were to experience a change of control without obtaining fund investor consent. We cannot be certain that consents required for the assignment of our management agreements will be obtained if such a deemed change of control occurs. The governing agreements of certain of the funds we manage allow the investors of those funds to, among other things, (i) terminate the commitment period of the fund in the event that certain key persons fail to devote the requisite time to managing the fund, (ii) (depending on the fund) terminate the commitment period, dissolve the fund or remove the general partner if we, as general partner or manager, or certain key persons engage in certain forms of misconduct, (iii) dissolve the fund or terminate the commitment period upon the affirmative vote of a specified percentage of limited partner interests entitled to vote, or (iv) dissolve the fund or terminate the commitment period upon a change of control. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of the funds we manage would likely result in significant reputational damage to us. Investors in some of the funds we manage may also at times redeem their investments on an annual, semiannual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be redeemed (typically between one and five years). In a declining market, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our AUM could accelerate. The decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in these funds could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, revenues, net income and cash flows. Certain investors have placed increasing importance on the impact of investments made by the funds to which they commit capital on environmental, social and governance-related issues. Consequently, certain investors may decide not to commit capital in fundraises, or to withdraw previously committed capital from the funds we manage, based on their evolving priorities. Certain investors may also condition capital commitments in a way that may constrain our capital deployment opportunities, including by limiting investment opportunities in certain sectors, or taking certain actions, or refraining therefrom, that could adversely impact the value of an investment or that could improve the value of an investment. In addition, regulatory initiatives requiring asset managers and investors to classify certain funds and their investments against certain criteria are becoming increasingly common. Some categorization requirements may be subjective and, accordingly, open to interpretation. If regulators disagree with the categorization methodologies we use, or new regulations, legislation, or regulatory guidance require a methodology of measuring or disclosing sustainability-related information that is diﬀerent from our current practice, it could have an adverse eﬀect on fundraising eﬀorts. Given the increasing scrutiny on environmental, social and governance-related matters as well as the increasing number of regulatory obligations relating to our business, our investors, the funds we manage, and their investments, there is an increasing risk that we could be perceived as or accused of making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding the investment strategies of the funds we manage, as well as about our, the funds, and their investments performance against sustainability-related measures and/or initiatives. Any such perception or accusation could adversely impact our ability to raise capital and attract new investors. Conversely, so-called anti-ESG sentiment has also gained momentum across the U.S., with several states having enacted or proposed anti-ESG policies, legislation or issued related legal opinions. For example, boycott bills in certain states target financial institutions that are perceived as boycotting or discriminating against companies in certain industries (e.g., energy and mining) and prohibit state entities from doing business with such institutions and/or investing the states assets (including pension plan assets) through such institutions. In addition, certain states now require that relevant state entities or managers/administrators of state investments make investments based solely on pecuniary factors without consideration of environmental, social and governance factors. If investors subject to such legislation viewed our funds, policies or practices as being in contradiction of such anti-ESG policies, legislation or legal opinions, such investors may not invest in our funds, our ability to maintain the size of our funds could be impaired, and it could negatively affect the price of our common stock. 42 Table of Contents Historical performance metrics are unreliable indicators of our current or future results of operations. We have presented returns relating to the historical performance of the funds we manage and certain targets of our future performance, including by reference to the internal rate of return (IRR) of certain funds performance using a gross IRR and a net IRR calculation. The returns are relevant to us primarily insofar as they are indicative of performance fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, our reputation and our ability to raise new funds. The returns of the funds we manage are not, however, directly linked to returns on our shares of common stock. Moreover, the historical returns of the funds we manage should not be considered indicative of the future returns of such funds or any future funds we may raise. Performance metrics, such as IRR, going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical performance generated by any particular fund, or for the funds we manage as a whole. Valuations for the funds we manage entail significant complications and are not an indicator for actual realizations. We value the illiquid investments held by the funds we manage based on our estimate of their fair value as of the date of determination based on third-party models, or models developed by us. In addition, because many of the illiquid investments held by the funds we manage are in industries or sectors that are unstable, in distress, or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments. We also include the fair value of illiquid assets in the calculations of net asset values, returns of the funds we manage and our AUM. Furthermore, we recognize performance fees based in part on these estimated fair values. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate greatly from period to period. Also, they may vary greatly from the prices that would be obtained if the assets were to be liquidated on the date of the valuation and often do vary greatly from the prices the funds we manage eventually realize. If a fund realizes value on an investment that is significantly lower than the value at which it was reflected in a funds net asset values, the fund would suffer losses. This could in turn lead to a decline in our management fees and a loss equal to the portion of the performance fees reported in prior periods that was not actually realized upon disposition, and could slow the pace and reduce the likelihood that we earn carried interest. These effects could become applicable to a large number of investments by the funds we manage if the funds current valuations differ from future valuations due to market developments or other factors that are beyond our control. If asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values, fund investors could lose confidence which could, in turn, result in redemptions from the funds we manage that permit redemptions or difficulties in raising additional capital. Investments made by the funds we manage entail significant risks and uncertainties. We invest in a number of industries, products, geographical locations and strategies that entail significant risks and uncertainties, which may, if realized, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example:  The funds we manage often invest in companies with weak financial conditions, poor operating results, substantial financial needs, negative net worth and/or special competitive or regulatory problems, including in business enterprises that are or may become involved in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions.  Investments by many of the funds we manage include debt instruments, equity securities, and other financial instruments of companies that the funds we manage do not control. Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve the interests of the funds we manage.  We generally establish the capital structure of portfolio companies and certain other fund investments, including real estate investments, on the basis of financial projections for such investments that are based primarily on management judgments.  The funds we manage acquire and dispose of investments that are subject to contingent liabilities, which could be unknown to us at the time of the transaction or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present, and could in each case result in unforeseen losses for the funds we manage.  A significant portion or all of a funds capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company and a loss with respect to such an investment or portfolio company could have a significant adverse impact on such funds capital. 43 Table of Contents  Certain of the funds we manage invest in infrastructure assets and real assets, which may expose us and the funds we manage to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership, development and monetization of real assets.  The funds we manage invest in assets denominated in currencies that differ from the currency in which the relevant fund is denominated.  We have undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we could offer to investors. In each of these cases, the investments are exposed to significant risks and uncertainties, including regulatory and legal risks and oversight, adverse publicity and investor perceptions, reputational harm, counterparty default risk, inaccuracy of financial projections, inability to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of the investment, increased likelihood that the assumptions on which we have based the investment are delayed, change or are never materialized, the effect of disruptions or volatility in the financial markets, inflation, commodity price risk, and additional exposures associated with attempts to hedge and otherwise protect from the downside of the investments. In each instance, if such risks were to materialize, the objective of our investments may not be fully realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and the industries in which the funds we manage invest. Our performance and the performance of many of the funds we manage are significantly affected by the value of the companies in which the funds we manage have invested. The funds we manage invest in companies in many different industries, each of which is subject to volatility based upon a variety of factors, including economic, political and market factors. For example:  The performance of certain of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage in the leisure and hospitality industry has been negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, and geopolitical events, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  The performance of the investments of the funds we manage in the commodities markets is substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas, which have been impacted by the ongoing global energy crisis.  The investments of the funds we manage in companies in the financial services sector are subject to government regulations, disclosure requirements, limits on fees, increasing borrowing costs or limits on the terms or availability of credit to such portfolio companies, and other regulatory requirements each of which may impact the conduct of such portfolio companies.  The real estate investments of the funds we manage are exposed to rising mortgage interest rates, increasing consumer debt and a low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market.  Investments of the funds we manage in commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real-estate related loans are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with mortgage loans made on the security of residential properties, and success of tenant businesses, property management decisions, competition from comparable types of properties and declines in regional or local real estate values and rental or occupancy rates.  Investments of the funds we manage in the power and energy industries involve various risks, including regulatory and market risks. The increased scrutiny of regulators and investors on the negative impacts of the power and energy industries may negatively impact the value of investments in these sectors and our ability to exit certain investments on favorable terms. Future regulatory or legislative efforts by government agencies could place additional limitations on carbon-intensive forms of power generation or the exploration, mining, extraction, distribution and/or refining of certain fossil fuels. In addition, portfolio companies of the funds we manage across a wide range of industries have experienced significant challenges in their global supply chain, including shortages in supply, or disruptions or delays in shipments, of certain materials or components used in their products, and related price increases. While to date many of these portfolio companies have been able to manage the challenges associated with these delays and shortages without significant disruption to their business, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful. Deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment may cause decreased demand for the products and services of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for their products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. 44 Table of Contents The performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected to the extent the portfolio companies of the funds we manage experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends in their respective industries. The funds that we manage in our yield strategy are subject to numerous additional risks. The funds we manage in our yield strategy are subject to numerous additional risks, including the risks set forth below.  The funds we manage may concentrate investments in any one borrower or other issuer, product category, industry, region or country.  The funds we manage sometimes hold positions (including outright positions in issuers and exposure to such issuers derived through any synthetic and/or derivative instrument) in multiple tranches of securities of an issuer (or other interests of an issuer) or multiple funds sometimes have interests in the same tranche of an issuer.  Certain of these funds may engage in short-selling, which is subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss.  These funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss.  The efficacy of the investment and trading strategies of certain funds may depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of different financial instruments, which can be difficult to execute.  Certain of these funds originate, acquire or participate in (including through assignments and sub-participation) loans, including, but not limited to, secured and unsecured notes, senior and second lien loans, mezzanine loans, non-performing loans or other high-risk receivables and other similar investments in below investment grade or unrated debt which are or may become illiquid.  These funds investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, swaps, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances. Risks Related to Our Retirement Services Business A financial strength rating downgrade, potential downgrade or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our product offerings less attractive, inhibit our ability to acquire future business through acquisitions or reinsurance and increase our cost of capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) review the financial performance and condition of insurers and reinsurers, including our subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurers ability to meet policyholder obligations. These ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our insurance subsidiaries products, our insurance subsidiaries ability to market their products and our competitive position. Factors that could negatively influence this analysis include:  changes to the business practices or organizational business plan of our retirement services business in a manner that no longer supports its ratings;  unfavorable financial or market trends;  changes in NRSROs capital adequacy assessment methodologies in a manner that would adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries;  a need to increase reserves to support the outstanding insurance obligations of our retirement services business;  our inability to retain our senior management and other key personnel;  rapid or excessive growth, especially through large reinsurance transactions or acquisitions, beyond the bounds of capital sufficiency or management capabilities as judged by the NRSROs; and  significant losses to the investment portfolio of our retirement services business. Some other factors may also relate to circumstances outside of our control, such as views of the NRSRO and general economic conditions. Any downgrade or other negative action by a NRSRO with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, or an entity we acquire, or credit ratings of our retirement services business, could materially adversely affect us and our retirement services business ability to compete in many ways, including the following:  reducing new sales of insurance products; 45 Table of Contents  harming relationships with or perceptions of distributors, IMOs, sales agents, banks and broker-dealers;  increasing the number or amount of policy lapses or surrenders and withdrawals of funds, which may result in a mismatch of our overall asset and liability position;  requiring our retirement services business to offer higher crediting rates or greater policyholder guarantees on its insurance products in order to remain competitive;  increase borrowing costs of our retirement services business;  reducing the level of profitability and capital position of our retirement services business generally or hindering its ability to raise new capital; or  requiring our retirement services business to collateralize obligations under or result in early or unplanned termination of hedging agreements and harming the ability of our retirement services business to enter into new hedging agreements. In order to improve or maintain their financial strength ratings, our subsidiaries may attempt to implement business strategies to improve their capital ratios. We cannot guarantee any such measures will be successful. We cannot predict what actions NRSROs may take in the future, and failure to maintain current financial strength ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our retirement services business is subject to significant operating and financial restrictions imposed by its credit agreements and certain letters of credit and it is also subject to certain operating restrictions imposed by the indenture to which it is a party. On June 30, 2023, AHL, ALRe, AUSA and AARe, as borrowers, entered into a new, five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the AHL Credit Facility), which replaced the previous revolving credit agreement dated December 3, 2019. Also on June 30, 2023, AHL and ALRe entered into a new revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the AHL Liquidity Facility), which replaced the previous revolving credit agreement dated as of July 1, 2022. The AHL Credit Facility, the AHL Liquidity Facility and certain AHL letters of credit also entered into contain various covenants, which restrict the operations of our retirement services business. As a result of these restrictions, our retirement services business may be limited in how it conducts its operations and may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition to the covenants to which our retirement services business is subject pursuant to the AHL Credit Facility, AHL Liquidity Facility and certain letters of credit, AHL is also subject to certain limited covenants pursuant to the indenture, dated January 12, 2018, by and between AHL and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the applicable supplemental indenture, by and among us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the AHL Indenture). The AHL Indenture contains restrictive covenants which limit, subject to certain exceptions, AHLs and, in certain instances, some or all of its subsidiaries ability to make fundamental changes, create liens on any capital stock of certain of AHLs subsidiaries, and sell or dispose of the stock of certain of AHLs subsidiaries. The terms of any future indebtedness of our retirement services business may contain additional restrictive covenants. If we are unable to attract and retain IMOs, banks and broker-dealers, sales of our retirement services products may be adversely affected. In our retirement services business, we distribute annuity products through a variable cost distribution network, which includes numerous IMOs, banks and broker-dealers, collectively representing numerous independent agents. We must attract and retain such marketers, agents and financial institutions to sell our products. In particular, insurance companies compete vigorously for productive agents. We compete with other life insurance companies for marketers, agents and financial institutions primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation, credit ratings and product features. Such marketers, agents and financial institutions may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than we do. Our competitiveness for such marketers, agents and financial institutions also depends upon the long-term relationships we develop with them. There can be no assurance that such relationships will continue in the future. In addition, our growth plans include increasing the distribution of annuity products through banks and broker-dealers. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers and agents to sell our products or if we are not successful in expanding our distribution channels within the bank and broker-dealer markets, our ability to compete and our sales volumes and results of operations could be adversely affected. 46 Table of Contents As a financial services company, we are exposed to liquidity risk, which is the risk that we are unable to meet near-term obligations as they come due. Liquidity risk is a manifestation of events that are driven by other risk types ( e.g. , market, policyholder behavior, operational). A liquidity shortfall may arise in the event of insufficient funding sources or an immediate and significant need for cash or collateral. In addition, it is possible that expected liquidity sources, such as the AHL Credit Facility and AHL Liquidity Facility, may be unavailable or inadequate to satisfy the liquidity demands described below. In particular, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and inflation and the responses by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to contribute to volatility in the financial markets and may restrict the liquidity sources available to us and further may result in an increase of our liquidity demands. We primarily have liquidity exposure through our collateral market exposure, asset liability mismatch, dependence on the financial markets for funding and funding commitments. If a material liquidity demand is triggered and we are unable to satisfy the demand with the sources of liquidity readily available to us, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash

=== ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT ===

. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of our liquidity and sources and uses of liquidity, including information about legal and regulatory limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. The amount of statutory capital that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have, or that they are required to hold, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control. The U.S. insurance subsidiaries of our retirement services business are subject to state regulations that provide for minimum capital requirements (MCR) based on risk-based capital (RBC) formulas for life insurance companies relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate and certain other risks. Similarly, the Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries of our retirement services business are subject to MCR imposed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) through the BMAs Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) and minimum margin of solvency. In any particular year, our subsidiaries capital ratios and/or statutory surplus amounts may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and some of which we can only partially control, including, but not limited to, the following:  the amount of statutory income or loss generated by our insurance subsidiaries;  the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support their business growth;  changes in reserve requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries;  changes in market value of certain securities in our investment portfolio;  recognition of write-downs or other losses on investments held in the investment portfolio of our retirement services business;  changes in the credit ratings of investments held in the investment portfolio of our retirement services business;  changes in the value of certain derivative instruments;  changes in interest rates;  credit market volatility;  changes in policyholder behavior;  changes in corporate tax rates;  changes to the RBC formulas and interpretations of the NAIC instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies; and  changes to the ECR, Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR), or target capital level (TCL) formulas and interpretations of the BMAs instructions with respect to ECR, BSCR, or TCL calculation methodologies. Further to NAIC activities with respect to RBC calculation methodologies, the NAIC has recently adopted and is currently considering a variety of reforms to its RBC framework, which could increase the capital requirements for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. For example, the NAIC recently adopted changes to certain statements of statutory accounting principles in connection with its principles-based bond project, which are currently scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2025, setting forth the factors to determine whether an investment in asset-backed securities qualifies for reporting on an insurers statutory financial statement as a bond on Schedule D-1 as opposed to Schedule BA (other long-term invested assets), the latter of which could result, among other things, in the capital charge treatment of an investment being less favorable. The NAIC also adopted an interim change to the life RBC formula for year-end 2023 and 2024 reporting to increase the RBC base factor for residual tranches of structured securities, and will further consider whether to increase or decrease the base factor in 2024. In addition, the NAIC is reviewing changes related to filing exempt status for certain securities, including a proposal that sets forth 47 Table of Contents procedures for the NAICs review of investments that are exempt from filing with the NAICs Securities Valuation Office, which could result in, among other things, the capital charge treatment of the investment being less favorable. During the course of 2023, the BMA issued consultation papers, and received feedback from stakeholders, on certain proposed enhancements to Bermudas regulatory regime for commercial insurers. The enhancements are aimed at ensuring that the regime continues to remain fit for purpose, in line with international standards and keeps pace with market developments. In addition to potential enhancements to technical provisions and computation of the BSCR, the BMA is seeking to strengthen supervisory cooperation and exchange of information and increased publication of regulatory information to further develop good governance and risk management practices, transparency, and market discipline. As at the end of 2023, draft rules and guidance notes were published for each commercial insurer class and insurance groups with the new requirements expected to come into force on March 31, 2024. NRSROs may also implement changes to their internal models, which differ from the RBC and BSCR capital models, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our subsidiaries must hold in order to maintain their current ratings. To the extent that one of our insurance subsidiarys solvency or capital ratios is deemed to be insufficient by one or more NRSROs to maintain their current ratings, we may take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If we are unable to accomplish such actions, NRSROs may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade. Regulatory developments, including the NAICs adoption of amendments to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Model Regulation requiring, subject to certain exceptions, that our retirement services business file a confidential annual group capital calculation and an annual liquidity stress test with the Iowa Insurance Division, the lead state insurance regulator of its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, may increase the amount of capital that our retirement services business is required to hold and could result in it being subject to increased regulatory requirements. If a subsidiarys solvency or capital ratios reach certain minimum levels, it could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by our insurance regulators. Corrective actions may include limiting our subsidiaries ability to write additional business, increased regulatory supervision, or seizure or liquidation of the subsidiarys business, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Repurchase agreement programs subject us to potential liquidity and other risks. Our retirement services business may engage in repurchase agreement transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. These repurchase agreements provide our retirement services business with liquidity and in certain instances also allow it to earn spread income. Under such agreements, our retirement services business may be required to deliver additional securities or cash as margin to the counterparty if the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date. If our retirement services business is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral or post cash or securities as margin on short notice or have inadequate cash on hand as of the repurchase date, it may be forced to sell securities to meet such obligations and may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner or may be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than it otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions. Rehypothecation of subject securities by the counterparty may also create risk with respect to the counterpartys ability to perform its obligations to tender such securities on the repurchase date. Such facilities may not be available to our retirement services business on favorable terms or at all in the future. Our retirement services business is subject to the credit risk of its counterparties, including ceding companies, reinsurers, plan sponsors, and derivative counterparties. Athene and its insurance subsidiaries encounter various types of counterparty credit risk. Athenes insurance subsidiaries cede certain risk to third-party insurance companies that may cover large volumes of business and expose them to a concentration of credit risk with respect to such counterparties. Such subsidiaries may not have a security interest in the underlying assets and despite certain indemnification rights, they retain liability to their policyholders if a counterparty fails to perform. Certain of Athenes insurance subsidiaries also reinsure liabilities from other insurance companies and these subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by changes in the ceding companies ratings, creditworthiness, and market perception, or any policy administration issues. Athene further assumes pension obligations from plan sponsors that expose it to the credit risk of the plan sponsor. In addition, our retirement services business is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by its derivative agreement counterparties. If any of these counterparties is not able to satisfy its obligations to us or third parties, including policyholders, we may not achieve our targeted returns and our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow may be materially adversely affected. 48 Table of Contents The investment portfolio of our retirement services business may be subject to concentration risk, particularly with respect to single issuers, including Athora, among others; industries, including financial services; and asset classes, including real estate. Our retirement services business faces single issuer concentration risk both in the context of strategic alternative investments, in which it occasionally holds significant equity positions, and large asset trades, in which it generally holds significant debt positions. The most significant concentration risk exposures of our retirement services business arising in the context of strategic alternative investments, on a risk-adjusted basis, is its investment in Athora, an insurance holding company focused on the European life insurance market. Given our retirement services business significant exposure to these issuers, it is subject to the risks inherent in their business. For example, as a life insurer, Athora is subject to credit risk with respect to its investment portfolio and mortality risk with respect to its product liabilities, each of which may be exacerbated by unforeseen events. Further, Athora has significant European operations, which expose it to volatile economic conditions and risks relating to European member countries and withdrawals thereof, such as the U.K. In addition, Athora is subject to multiple legal and regulatory regimes that may hinder or prevent it from achieving its business objectives. To the extent that our retirement services business suffers a significant loss on its investment in these issuers, including Athora, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, in order to facilitate certain large asset trades and in exchange for commitment fees, our retirement services business may commit to purchasing a larger portion of an investment than it ultimately expects to retain, and in such instances our retirement services business is reliant upon the ability of our asset management business to syndicate the transaction to other investors. If our asset management business is unsuccessful in its syndication efforts, our retirement services business may be exposed to greater concentration risk than what it would deem desirable from a risk appetite perspective and the commitment fee that it receives may not adequately compensate it for this risk. Our retirement services business also has significant investments in nonbank lenders focused on providing financing to individuals or entities. As a result, through these investments, we have significant exposure to credit risk. In addition to the concentration risk arising from our retirement services business investments in single issuers within the nonbank lending sector of the financial services industry, we have significant exposure to the financial services industry more broadly as a result of the composition of investments in our retirement services business investment portfolio. Economic volatility or any further macroeconomic, regulatory or other changes having an adverse impact on the financial services industry more broadly, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of the net invested assets of our retirement services business is invested in real estate-related assets. Any significant decline in the value of real estate generally or the occurrence of any of the risks described elsewhere in this report with respect to the real estate-related investments of our retirement services business could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, through the investments of our retirement services business in CML and CMBS, we have exposure to certain categories of commercial property, including office buildings and retail, that have been adversely affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the work from home trend. In addition, the CML our retirement services business holds, and the CML underlying the CMBS that our retirement services business holds, face both default and delinquency risk. Conflicts of Interest Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses. We increasingly confront potential and actual conflicts of interest relating to our business, our investment activities and the investment activities of the funds we manage. As an asset manager, conflicts of interest can arise in connection with investment decisions, including regarding the identification, making, management, valuation, disposition, and timing of a funds investments. These conflicts of interest include conflicts that arise among the funds we manage as well as between us and the funds we manage and other client accounts. Certain inherent conflicts of interest arise from the fact that (i) we provide investment management services to more than one fund or client, (ii) the funds we manage often have one or more overlapping investment strategies, and (iii) we could choose to allocate an investment to more than one fund or to ourselves. Also, the investment strategies employed by us for current and future clients, or on our own behalf, could conflict with each other, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of other securities or instruments held by, or potentially considered for, one or more clients. If participation in specific investment opportunities is appropriate for more than one of the funds or other advisory clients we manage, participation in such opportunities will be allocated pursuant to our allocation policies and procedures, 49 Table of Contents which take into account the terms of the relevant partnership or investment management agreement as well as the decisions of our allocations committees. In addition to the potential for conflict among the funds and accounts we manage, we face the potential for conflict between us and the funds we manage or clients. These conflicts may include: (i) the allocation of investment opportunities between Apollo and the funds Apollo manages; (ii) the allocation of investment opportunities among funds with different performance fee structures, or where our personnel have invested more heavily in one fund than another; (iii) the determination of what constitutes fund-related expenses and the allocation of such expenses between our advised funds and us; and (iv) the ability of our personnel to, in certain circumstances, make investments in the funds we manage or funds managed by third parties on more favorable terms. Further, from time to time, issues arise that present actual conflicts of interest, including between us and the funds we manage, among the funds we manage, or between our employees and the funds we manage. Examples of such conflicts include, without limitation, side-by-side managed funds with overlapping investment mandates; affiliated transactions (including principal transactions) between the funds we manage and/or between the funds we manage and Apollo and/or their portfolio investments; multi-tranche investments where the funds we manage are invested in one or more tranches of a portfolio investment while others are invested on a non-pari passu basis in the same or different tranches of such investment; and the use of affiliated service providers. Funds we manage hold interests in businesses, including operating companies and/or portfolio investments, that originate assets on a recurring basis, which we refer to as origination platforms. Through their origination business, the origination platforms create investment opportunities for us, our affiliates, as well as for the funds we manage in addition to third parties. Where such investment opportunities are allocated to the funds we manage, they can give rise to management fees, incentive compensation payable or allocable to us, and additional transaction-based compensation payable to our affiliated service providers, including the capital solutions fees discussed herein, which gives rise to conflicts of interest among us and the funds we manage. The documents of the funds we manage typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to co-investments. The investment advisers of the funds and accounts we manage may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to the funds we manage (including, for example, as part of an investors overall strategic relationship with us) if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or performance allocations to us than would arise if such co-investment opportunities were allocated otherwise. The funds we manage invest in portfolio companies whose operations may be substantially similar to and/or competitive with the portfolio companies in which our other funds have invested. The performance and operation of such competing businesses could conflict with and adversely affect the performance and operation of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of business opportunities or transactions available to such portfolio companies. In addition, we may take different actions across funds with similar investment programs, objectives or strategies. For example, one of the private equity funds we manage could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition, divestiture or other transaction, even though the proposed transaction would subject one or more of the investments of the credit funds we manage to additional or increased risks. We may also advise clients with investment objectives or strategies that conflict with those of certain of the funds we manage. We, the funds we manage or the portfolio companies of the funds we manage may also have ongoing relationships with issuers whose securities have been acquired by, or are being considered for investment by us. In addition, a dispute may arise between the portfolio companies of the funds we manage, and the investors in the funds we manage may be dissatisfied with our handling of such dispute. We generally operate without information barriers in our asset management business (with limited exceptions based on established policies and procedures in respect of information barriers) that some other investment management firms implement to separate business units and/or to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material non-public information that could influence such decisions. Our executive officers, investment professionals or other employees may acquire confidential or material non-public information and, as a result, they, we, the funds we manage and other clients may be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. In the event that any of our employees obtains such material non-public information, we may be restricted in acquiring or disposing of investments on behalf of the funds we manage, which could impact the returns generated for such funds. Notwithstanding the maintenance of restricted securities lists and other internal controls, it is possible that the internal controls relating to the management of material non-public information could fail and result in us, or one of our investment professionals, buying or selling a security while, at least constructively, in possession of material non-public information. Inadvertent trading on material non-public information could have adverse effects on our reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions and, as a consequence, negatively impact our ability to provide our investment management services to our clients and the funds we manage. 50 Table of Contents The functions of certain of our affiliates also give rise to a number of conflicts of interest. For example, certain of our affiliates are broker-dealers registered with the SEC and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) that principally conduct private placements and provide services in respect of the underwriting and syndication of securities, transaction advisory services, capital markets advisory and structuring services, sourcing services and merger and acquisition advisory services. Additionally, certain of our affiliates and/or portfolio companies of the funds we manage provide a variety of services with respect to financial instruments, including loans, that are not subject to broker-dealer regulations, such as originating, administering, arranging, structuring, placing and syndicating loans, debt advisory and other similar services to the funds we manage and their portfolio companies, as well as third parties. While we believe these kinds of transactions are beneficial to our clients and the funds we manage, the functions that our affiliates may perform give rise to a number of conflicts of interest, including, for example, with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities. In connection with the services rendered by our affiliates to the funds we manage and their portfolio companies, such affiliates and/or the portfolio companies receive fees from the funds we manage, portfolio companies of the funds we manage and third-party borrowers. Furthermore, a borrower or an issuer may view all fees, expense reimbursements and interest related to financing (or similar instrument) as one charge it is incurring as part of our financing package to them and therefore doesnt distinguish between (x) the fees paid to our affiliates and (y) returns earned by the funds we manage whether in the form of interest, investment returns or other fees. This can lead to less negotiation over fees paid to our affiliates, potentially resulting in reduced returns for the funds we manage and an incentive to pursue investment opportunities with greater fee opportunities for our affiliates that could create a bias towards investment opportunities that generate the greatest amount of fee opportunities for our affiliates even at the expense of the investment returns sought by our clients and the funds we manage. Consequently, our relationship with these entities may give rise to conflicts of interest between (i) us and portfolio companies of the funds we manage and/or (ii) us and the funds we manage. Additionally, some of our personnel are dual affiliated with other organizations, including our affiliated broker-dealers. We employ commercially reasonable efforts to use separate teams for investment opportunities (one for our affiliated investment manager and the other for our affiliated service provider) and identify the separate services provided by each team in order to seek to ensure that the services provided by each team are readily distinguishable from each other. However, we may not be able to maintain a distinct set of services provided by the two teams for some investment opportunities, and such dual affiliation gives rise to conflicts of interest, including for example with respect to allocation of time, resources, and investment opportunities. Certain of our executive officers and senior investment professionals have established family offices to provide investment advisory, accounting, administrative and other services to their respective family accounts (including certain charitable accounts) in connection with their personal investment activities unrelated to their investments in Apollo entities. The investment activities of the family offices, and the involvement of the executive officer or senior investment professional in these activities may give rise to potential conflicts between the personal financial interests of the executive officer or senior investment professional and the interests of us, any of our subsidiaries or any stockholder other than such executive officer or senior investment professional. From time to time, we finance, securitize or employ structured finance arrangements in respect of certain of our balance sheet assets. We could also employ structured financing arrangements with respect to co-investment interests and investments in other funds made by our entities (including, potentially, co-investments with the funds we manage). These structured financing arrangements could alter our returns and risk exposure with respect to the applicable balance sheet assets as compared to our returns and risk exposure if we held such assets outside of such structured financing arrangements, and could create incentives for us to take actions in respect of such assets that we otherwise would not in the absence of such arrangements or otherwise alter our alignment with investors in such investments. These arrangements could also result in us realizing liquidity with respect to our equity investment in a fund or other entity at a different point in time (including earlier) than the limited partners of such entity. In addition to such finance arrangements, we also opportunistically invest or otherwise deploy the assets on our balance sheet. Such investments may create a platform of businesses directly owned by us, outside of the funds we manage and their portfolio companies or directly owned by the funds we manage. We may be subject to increased conflicts of interest between operating such platform businesses and the funds we manage and their portfolio companies. In addition, certain entities in which Apollo has made a balance sheet investment also may provide services to Apollo, the funds we manage or their portfolio companies, which may give rise to conflicts of interest. In addition, the funds we manage may, subject to applicable requirements in their governing documents, which may include obtaining advisory board consent, determine to sell a particular portfolio investment into a separate vehicle, which may be 51 Table of Contents managed by us, with different terms ( i.e. , longer duration) than the fund that originally acquired the portfolio investment, and provide limited partners with the option to monetize their investment with the fund at the time of such sale, or to roll all or a portion of their interest in the portfolio investment into a new vehicle. Under such circumstances, we may invest in or alongside the new vehicle, or hold the entirety of the portfolio investment sold by the fund through or alongside the new vehicle ( i.e. , in the event that all limited partners elect to monetize their investment at the time of sale to the new vehicle). As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise across the funds we manage, limited partners, and us. Most of the funds we manage obtain subscription line facilities to facilitate investments and operations, including the payment of fees and expenses. If an investment fund obtains a subscription line facility, the funds working capital needs will in most instances be satisfied through borrowings by the fund under the subscription line facility, and, less so, by drawdowns of capital contributions by the fund. As a result, capital calls are expected to be conducted in larger amounts on a less frequent basis in order to, among other things, repay borrowings and related interest expenses due under such subscription line facilities. Where an investment fund uses borrowings under a subscription line facility in advance or in lieu of receiving capital contributions from investors to repay any such borrowings and related interest expenses, the use of such facility will result in a different (and perhaps higher) reported internal rate of return than if the facility had not been utilized and instead capital contributions from investors had been contributed at the inception of an investment. This may present conflicts of interest. Because the preferred return of investment funds typically does not accrue on such borrowings, but rather only accrues on capital contributions when made, the use of such subscription line facilities may reduce or eliminate the preferred return received by the investors and accelerate or increase distributions of performance-based allocation to the relevant general partner. This will provide the general partner with an economic incentive to fund investments through such facilities in lieu of capital contributions. However, since interest expense and other costs of borrowings under subscription lines of credit are an expense of the investment fund, the investment funds incurred expenses will be increased, which may reduce the amount of performance fees generated by the fund. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses. We are subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations and requirements to obtain and maintain licenses and/or other approvals, by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of the various laws and regulations to wh

=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

ct are discussed in Item 1. BusinessRegulatory and Compliance Matters. As detailed in that section, certain of our businesses, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are, among others, regulated under the Investment Advisers Act; the Investment Company Act; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive; the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; the EU General Data Protection Regulation (as implemented in countries in the European Economic Area) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation; the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 and potentially various new and emerging EU and U.K. cybersecurity laws; the Cayman Islands Data Protection Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and a variety of other U.S. state privacy and cybersecurity laws; the Regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories; as well as by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and similar non-U.S. regulators; the Federal Reserve; the SEC; FINRA; the U.S. Department of Labor; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Federal Communications Commission; insurance regulators in U.S. states, the EU, Bermuda, U.K., Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Canada, Cayman Islands and Malaysia; banking regulators in Germany, Slovenia and Spain; as well as rules and regulations regarding CLO risk retention, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, over the counter derivatives markets, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, gaming companies, and natural resources companies. We distribute many of our products through financial intermediaries, including third-party broker-dealers, and as such, increasing broker-dealer regulation (particularly concerning marketing and sales practices) could make it more difficult and expensive for us to distribute such products. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other parties, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as economic sanctions and export control laws administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State. 52 Table of Contents Increasingly, we are or may be subject to new initiatives and additional rules and regulations relating to sustainable finance and/or environmental, social and governance matters, including but not limited to: in the EU, the EU Regulation on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment as well as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and supporting regulatory technical standards; and, in the U.K., the U.K. FCAs disclosure rules for asset managers aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures as well as the forthcoming Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and investment labelling regime and the proposed U.K. Green Taxonomy. Compliance with such laws and regulations requires increasing amounts of resources and the attention of our management team. Any violation, even if alleged, of such laws and regulations or any failure to obtain or maintain licenses and/or other regulatory approvals as required for our operations may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and prospects. Many of these laws and regulations empower regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions and insurance departments in the U.S., to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in penalties, fines, suspensions or revocations of licenses and/or other regulatory approvals, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, enforcement actions and settlements, or the suspension or expulsion of an investment adviser from registration or memberships. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors. These requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in the funds we manage and policyholders of our retirement services and other businesses and may not necessarily be designed to protect our stockholders. Other regulations, such as those promulgated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and similar foreign direct investment regimes in other jurisdictions, may impair our ability to invest the funds we manage and/or for such funds to realize full value from our investments in certain industries and countries. Our businesses may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by U.S. or foreign government agencies or self-regulatory organizations. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these government agencies and self-regulatory organizations. For instance, the SEC and other regulators have been increasing regulation of private funds and advisers to private funds, and this type of regulation may make it more difficult for us to manage and distribute both our private fund products and our products that are purchased by third-party private fund managers. In addition, each of the financial services and insurance industry is the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny as various U.S. state and federal government agencies and self-regulatory organizations conduct inquiries and investigations into the products and practices of the industry. Government agencies and insurance standard setters in the U.S. and worldwide have also become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial activities and systems in general, as indicated by the development of ComFrame, which will be applicable to IAIGs designated by their group-wide supervisor and includes a group capital requirement in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements and any group capital requirements imposed by relevant insurance laws and regulations. Consequently, we may be subject to new, divergent, conflicting, increasingly severe regulations and restrictions on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and prospects. On February 6, 2024, the IID identified Apollo as meeting the criteria as an IAIG and further identified Athene as the Head of the IAIG. In general, the Head of the IAIG is the uppermost entity to which obligations associated with an IAIG designation attach. As a result of these identifications, we expect Athene to be subject to the relevant capital standard that the U.S. applies to IAIGs. The IID further identified itself as the Group-Wide Supervisor for Apollo (in a distinct capacity from its role as supervisor for Athene). Iowa has been effectively serving in this role for a significant period of time; this identification is a formal recognition of the IIDs existing supervisory relationship to Apollo. At this time, we do not expect a significant impact on Athenes capital position or capital structure; however, we cannot fully predict with certainty the impact (if any) on Athenes capital position or capital structure and any other burdens being named an IAIG may impose on Athene or its insurance affiliates. Guaranty associations may also subject Athene to assessments that requires it to pay funds, subject to certain limits, to cover contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies which become impaired or insolvent. Although Athene has not historically paid material amounts in connection with these assessments, we cannot accurately predict the magnitude of such amounts in the future, or accurately predict which past or future insolvencies of competitors could lead to such assessments. Any such future assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows and any reserves we have previously established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. 53 Table of Contents We are subject to third-party litigation from time to time that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The activities of our businesses, including the investment activities of the funds we manage and activities of our employees in connection with the funds, their portfolio companies, our insurance subsidiaries, as well as publicly listed vehicles we manage or sponsor may subject us and certain of our employees to the risk of litigation by third parties, including fund investors dissatisfied with the performance or management of such funds, holders of our or the funds portfolio companies debt or equity, policyholders of our retirement services business, public stockholders and a variety of other potential litigants. In general, we will be exposed to risk of litigation by our investors if our management of any fund is alleged to constitute bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund, breach of fiduciary duties or securities laws, or other forms of misconduct. If such allegations are made against our Board or management, Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) allows stockholders to access corporate books and records to investigate wrongdoing. Fund investors could sue us to recover amounts lost by the funds we manage due to our alleged misconduct, up to the entire amount of loss. Further, we may be subject to litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of the funds we manage or from third-party allegations that we (i) improperly exercised control or influence over companies in which the funds we manage have large investments or (ii) are liable for actions or inactions taken by portfolio companies that such third parties argue we control. We are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation relating to transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed. Our rights to indemnification by the funds we manage may not be upheld if challenged, and our indemnification rights generally do not cover bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund or other forms of misconduct. With many highly paid investment professionals and complex compensation and incentive arrangements, we face the risk of lawsuits relating to claims for compensation, which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount. We are also increasingly faced with the risk of litigation or investigation in relation to environmental, social and/or governance-related issues given the increasing scrutiny of such issues by investors, other stakeholders, regulators, and other third parties as well as due to the increasing disclosure obligations on our businesses, the funds we manage, and their portfolio companies. Such risks may relate to accusations concerning but not limited to: (i) the activities of portfolio companies, including environmental damage and violations of labor and human rights; (ii) misrepresentations of the investment strategies of the funds we manage as well as about our, the funds, and their investments performance against environmental, social and/or governance-related measures and/or initiatives; or (iii) breaches of fiduciary duty in relation to the funds we manage and other violations of law related to the management of environmental, social and/or governance-related risks. If any civil or criminal litigation brought against us were to result in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability, the litigation could, in addition to any financial damage, cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage levels against potential liabilities we may face in connection with potential claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Taxation The tax treatment of our structure is complex and may be subject to change as a result of new laws or regulations or differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, under audit or otherwise, potentially on a retroactive basis. The tax treatment of our structure and transactions undertaken by us depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and U.S. state and local and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies, which frequently results in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. It is possible that future legislation increases the U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to corporations, limits further the deductibility of interest, or effects other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any particular proposed legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be, or whether it would have any effect on us. As such, we cannot assure you that future legislative, administrative or judicial developments will not result in an increase in the amount of U.S. (including state or local) or non-U.S. tax payable by us, the funds we manage, portfolio companies owned by such funds or by investors in our 54 Table of Contents shares. If any such developments occur, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and such developments could have an adverse effect on your investment in our shares. Our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner in which they apply to us and our subsidiaries is sometimes open to interpretation. Moreover, the application of such laws, regulations and treaties may not be compatible with one another. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be correct and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate and/or have other unforeseen adverse tax consequences. In addition, we or certain of our subsidiaries or certain portfolio companies of the funds we manage are currently (or have been recently) under tax audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions or any others where we conduct business may assess additional tax against us. While we believe our tax positions, determinations, and calculations are reasonable, the final determination of tax upon resolution of any audits could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional material taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment, or litigation, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Our structure is subject to a number of new minimum tax regimes, the implementation of which remains uncertain. These regimes may not be compatible with one another and may cause us adverse tax consequences. The U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD) and other government bodies and organizations in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or conduct business have continued to recommend and implement changes related to the taxation of multinational companies. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed and driven the implementation by its member countries of changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project, which is focused on a number of issues, including profit shifting among affiliated entities in different jurisdictions, interest deductibility and eligibility for the benefits of double tax treaties. The BEPS project includes a two-pillar initiative, BEPS 2.0, which is aimed at (1) shifting taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer (Pillar One) and (2) ensuring all companies pay a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Pillar One will, broadly, re-allocate taxing rights over 25% of the residual profits of multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover in excess of 20 billion euros (excluding extractives and regulated financial services) to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar Two will, broadly, consist of two interlocking domestic rules (together the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBE Rules)): (1) an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), which imposes top-up tax on a parent entity in respect of the low-taxed income of a constituent entity; and (2) an Undertaxed Payment Rule (UTPR), which denies deductions or requires an equivalent adjustment to the extent the low-taxed income of a constituent entity is not subject to tax under an IIR. There will also be a treaty-based Subject To Tax Rule that allows source jurisdictions to impose limited source taxation on certain related party payments subject to tax below a minimum rate. Several aspects of the model GloBE Rules, including whether some or all of our activities may fall within the scope of the exclusions therefrom, currently remain unclear or uncertain notwithstanding existing commentary and guidance. The United Kingdom enacted legislation in July 2023 implementing the IIR via a multinational top-up tax (MTT), alongside a U.K. domestic top-up tax, that will apply to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. It is likely that other countries or jurisdictions will implement the recommended model GloBE Rules (including either or both of the IIR or UTPR) as drafted or in a modified form, although some countries may not introduce such changes. As noted below, Bermuda has enacted the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (the Bermuda CIT) in response to the Pillar Two initiative. The implications of these rules for our business remain uncertain, both at a domestic level in Bermuda and in terms of how the Bermuda CIT, which does not come into full effect until January 1, 2025, might interact with the U.K. MTT and UTPR legislation or other Pillar Two implementing legislation in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, depending on how the model GloBE Rules are implemented or clarified by additional commentary or guidance in the future, they may result in material additional tax being payable by our business and the businesses of the companies in which we invest. The ultimate implementation of the BEPS project may also increase the complexity and the burden and costs 55 Table of Contents of compliance and advice relating to our ability to efficiently fund, hold and realize investments, and could necessitate or increase the probability of some restructuring of our group or business operations. The implementation of the BEPS project may also lead to additional complexity in evaluating the tax implications of ongoing investments and restructuring transactions within our business. As noted above, on December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Bermuda CIT. Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT generally will impose a 15% corporate income tax on entities that are tax residents in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment and are members of multi-national groups with consolidated revenues in excess of 750 million for at least two of the last four fiscal years. The Bermuda CIT also includes various transitional provisions and elections that may reduce the economic impact of the tax imposed. We expect that our subsidiaries that are organized in Bermuda generally will be subject to tax under the Bermuda CIT. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the Bermuda CIT on certain of our subsidiaries, including the transitional provisions and elections that are intended to mitigate the risk of an incremental cash tax burden. Prior to the enactment of the Bermuda CIT, certain of our subsidiaries had received from the Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, Tax Assurance Certificates that they generally would not be subject to income or estate tax until March 31, 2035. Despite the enactment of the Bermuda CIT, possible future amendments, regulations or other guidance thereto, and the limited nature and duration of the Tax Assurance Certificates, we do not expect to be subject to an amount of Bermuda taxes in the future that will materially negatively affect our earnings and results of operations in any given year but there can be no assurances that any such taxes will not be imposed. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA). The IRA contains a number of tax-related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations (CAMT) as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. Based on interpretations and assumptions we have made regarding the CAMT, which may change once further regulatory guidance is issued, we do not currently expect the CAMT to have a material impact on our financial condition. The impact of the IRA and the CAMT on our financial condition will depend on the facts and circumstances of each year. In addition, the U.S. has enacted, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) which also operates as a minimum tax and is generally calculated as a percentage (10% for taxable years before 2026 and 12.5% thereafter) of the modified taxable income of an applicable taxpayer and applies for a taxable year only to the extent it exceeds a taxpayers regular corporate income tax liability for such year, determined without regard to certain tax credits. Certain of our reinsurance agreements require our U.S. subsidiaries, including any non-U.S. subsidiaries that have elected to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, to pay or accrue substantial amounts to certain of our non-U.S. reinsurance subsidiaries that would be characterized as base erosion payments with respect to which there are base erosion tax benefits. These and any other base erosion payments may cause us to be subject to the BEAT. In addition, tax authorities may disagree with our BEAT calculations, or the interpretations on which those calculations are based, and assess additional taxes, interest and penalties. There may be material adverse consequences to our business if tax authorities successfully challenge our BEAT calculations, in light of the uncertainties described above. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation in an amount greater than expected. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are treated as foreign corporations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (such subsidiaries, the Non-U.S. Subsidiaries). Each of the Non-U.S. Subsidiaries currently intends to operate in a manner that will not cause it to be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net basis in any material amount. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether a foreign corporation is engaged in a trade or business (or has a permanent establishment) in the U.S., as the law is unclear and the determination is highly factual and must be made annually. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not successfully contend that a Non-U.S. Subsidiary that does not intend to be treated as engaged in a trade or business (or as having a permanent establishment) in the U.S. does, in fact, so engage (or have such a permanent establishment). If any such Non-U.S. Subsidiary is treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or as having a permanent establishment), it may incur greater tax costs than expected on any income not exempt from taxation under an applicable income tax treaty, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are treated as resident in the U.K. for U.K. tax purposes (the U.K. Resident Companies) and expect to qualify for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the U.S. and the U.K. (the U.K. Treaty) by reason of being subsidiaries of AGM or by reason of satisfying an ownership and base erosion test. Accordingly, our U.K. 56 Table of Contents Resident Companies are expected to qualify for certain exemptions from, or reduced rates of, U.S. federal taxes that are provided for by the U.K. Treaty. However, there can be no assurances that our U.K. Resident Companies will continue to qualify for treaty benefits or satisfy all of the requirements for the tax exemptions and reductions they intend to claim. If any of our U.K. Resident Companies fails to qualify for such benefits or satisfy such requirements, it may incur greater tax costs than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ownership of certain non-U.S. entities could cause us to be subject to U.S. federal income tax in amounts greater than expected, which could adversely affect the value of your investment. Certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through foreign subsidiaries that would be classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such entities may be passive foreign investment companies (PFICs) or controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, certain of our subsidiaries are non-U.S. companies and certain portfolio companies owned by the funds we manage are considered to be CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, in December 2017, the TCJA introduced changes to the determination of when a foreign corporation is treated as a CFC and whether a U.S. shareholder of a CFC is required to include its pro rata share of certain income generated by the CFC into income currently regardless of whether the shareholder receives any related distributions of cash. Aspects of these changes remain uncertain, and we may experience adverse U.S. tax consequences as a result of our ownership of non-U.S. companies, including the recognition of taxable income attributable to such companies non-U.S. operations and as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if a reinsurance agreement is entered into among related parties, the IRS is permitted to reallocate or recharacterize income, deductions or certain other items, and to make any other adjustment, to reflect the proper amount, source or character of the taxable income of each of the parties. Reinsurance agreements between our U.S. insurance companies and their Bermuda affiliates may be subject to such challenge by the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our reinsurance arrangements, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Changes in tax law could adversely impact our earnings. Many of the products that our retirement services business sells and reinsures benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current U.S. federal and state income tax regimes. For example, our retirement services business sells and reinsures annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. Future changes in U.S. federal or state tax law could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of such products, which could affect the sale of retirement services products or increase the expected lapse rate with respect to products that have already been sold. Decreases in product sales or increases in lapse rates, in either case, brought about by changes in U.S. tax law, may result in a decrease in net invested assets and therefore investment income and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), certain U.S. withholding agents, foreign financial institutions (FFIs), and non-financial foreign entities, are required to report information about offshore accounts and investments to the U.S. or their local taxing authorities annually or be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. payments. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require FFIs to comply with agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the IRS. The administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors. Other countries, such as the U.K., Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, have implemented regimes similar to that of FATCA. The OECD has also developed the Common Reporting Standard (the CRS) for exchange of information pursuant to which many countries have now signed multilateral agreements. Rules and regulations are currently and will continue to be introduced (particularly pursuant to the EU Directive on Administrative Co-Operation, or DAC 6, and the OECDs model Mandatory Disclosure Rules) which require the reporting to tax authorities of information about certain types of arrangements, including arrangements which may circumvent the CRS. Compliance with CRS and other similar regimes could result in increased administrative and compliance costs and could subject our investment entities to increased non-U.S. withholding taxes. In addition, several of the BEPS measures, including measures covering treaty abuse, the deductibility of interest expense, local nexus requirements, transfer pricing and hybrid mismatch arrangements, are relevant to some of our fund structures and could have an adverse impact on the funds we manage, investors and the portfolio companies of the funds we manage. OECD member countries have been moving forward on the BEPS agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted vary among participating member countries, significant uncertainty remains regarding the full impact of the 57 Table of Contents BEPS project for our business. Uncertainty remains around, among other matters, access to tax treaties for some of the investments holding platforms, which could create situations of double taxation and adversely impact the investment returns of the funds we manage. The European Union (EU) adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2016/1164 (commonly referred to as ATAD I), which directly implements some of the BEPS project actions points within EU law. The deadline for EU Member States to transpose ATAD I into domestic laws has passed and the Council of the EU formally adopted the Council Directive amending Directive (EU) 2016/1164 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries (commonly referred to as ATAD II). ATAD II has come into force in Member States (subject to relevant derogations). ATAD I and ATAD II could cause certain of our investments to be subject to double taxation which could adversely impact the investment returns of the funds we manage. Risks Related to Our Common Shares The market price and trading volume of our shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders. The market price of our shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. You may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price, if at all. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our shares include: variations in our quarterly operating results, which variations we expect will be substantial, or dividends; our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns; our creditworthiness, results of operations and financial condition; the credit ratings of the shares; dilution caused by the conversion of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock; the prevailing interest rates or rates of return being paid by other companies similar to us and the market for similar securities; failure to meet analysts earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our shares; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by stockholders; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; a lack of liquidity in the trading of our shares; adverse publicity about the investment management industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; a breach of our computer systems, software or networks, or misappropriation of our proprietary information; and economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events or conditions that affect us or the financial markets. An investment in our shares is not an investment in any of the funds we manage, and the assets and revenues of such funds are not directly available to us. Our shares are securities of Apollo Global Management, Inc. only. While our historical consolidated and combined financial information includes financial information, including assets and revenues of certain funds we manage on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund, and not to us except through management fees, performance fees, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, and the enforceability of the exclusive forum provision may be subject to uncertainty. Article XIV of our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following 58 Table of Contents such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision also provides that it will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction, in which case the U.S. federal district courts shall be the exclusive forum for such claims unless the Company consents in writing to an alternative forum. Stockholders cannot waive, and will not be deemed to have waived under the exclusive forum provision, the Companys compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive forum provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain. It is expected that we will continue to pay an annual dividend on our common stock, with increases based on the growth of the business as determined by our board of directors. The amount of dividends, if any, that are declared or paid to our stockholders, depends on a number of factors. Our board of directors will have sole discretion to determine whether any dividends will be declared, when dividends, if any, are declared, and the amount of such dividends. We expect that such determination would be based on a number of considerations, including our results of operations and capital management plans and the market price of our shares, the availability of funds, our access to capital markets as well as industry practice and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors, such as insurance regulatory requirements applicable to our subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends ultimately paid in respect of our shares will, in each case, be subject to receiving funds, directly or indirectly, from our operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL. Furthermore, the ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions and making prior distributions on the AHL outstanding preferred stock, and the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. There can be no guarantee that our stockholders will receive or be entitled to dividends commensurate with our historical dividends. In addition, on August 11, 2023, we issued 28,750,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with a dividend rate of 6.75% per annum on the liquidation preference of $50 per share. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. As long as any share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid in full or declared and set apart for payment, we may not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividends on our common stock or any other class or series of stock that ranks junior to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are discretionary and cumulative. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will only receive dividends on their shares when, as and if declared by our board of directors. If dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, together as a class with holders of any other series of parity stock with like voting rights, will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to our board of directors. This right to elect additional directors to our board of directors will dilute the representation of our stockholders on our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When quarterly dividends have been declared and set apart for payment in full, the right of the holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to elect these two additional directors will cease, the terms of office of these two directors will forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly. Additional risks related to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are contained in the prospectus supplement dated August 8, 2023. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY AGMs board of directors is involved in overseeing the Companys risk management program, including with respect to cybersecurity, which is a critical component of the Companys overall approach to enterprise risk management (ERM). For additional information about our risk management framework, see Part IIItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 59 Table of Contents About Market RiskRisk Management Framework. Our cybersecurity policies and practices are fully integrated into our ERM framework through our reporting, risk management and oversight channels and are based, in part, on recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and other applicable industry standards. As one of the critical elements of the Companys overall ERM approach, the Companys cybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas:  Governance. As discussed further under the heading Cybersecurity Governance, our board of directors has an oversight role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of AGMs risks, including our cybersecurity risks. AGMs Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and AHLs CISO, with support from the broader Technology team, are responsible for information security strategy, policies and practices.  Collaborative Approach. The Company utilizes a cross-functional approach involving stakeholders across multiple departments, including Compliance, Legal, Technology, Operations, Risk and others, aimed at identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of potentially material cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner.  Technical Safeguards. The Company deploys technical safeguards that are designed to protect the Companys information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved on an ongoing basis using vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence.  Incident Response and Recovery Planning . The Company has established and maintains incident response and recovery plans that address the Companys response to a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are tested and evaluated on a regular basis.  Third-Party Risk Management. The Company maintains a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of the Companys systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems.  Education and Awareness. The Company provides regular, mandatory training for personnel regarding cybersecurity threats to equip the Companys personnel with effective tools to help mitigate cybersecurity threats, and to communicate the Companys evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices. The Company engages in the periodic assessment and testing of the Companys policies and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, tabletop exercises, threat modeling, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures. The Company regularly engages third parties, including auditors and consultants, to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Companys risk management function, and the Company adjusts its cybersecurity policies and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits and reviews. Cybersecurity threat risks have not materially affected the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of the risks we face from cybersecurity threats, in

uld materially affect the Company, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsOperating Risks We rely on technology and information systems, many of which are controlled by third-party vendors, to maintain the security of our information and technology networks and to conduct our businesses, and any failures or interruptions of these systems could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Cybersecurity Governance In our asset management business, our board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risk management is supported by the audit committee of the AGM Board of Directors (the AGM Audit Committee), the AAM Global Risk Committee (AGRC), the Operational Risk Forum (the ORF), the Cybersecurity Working Group and management. Our board of directors, the AGM Audit Committee, the AGRC, the ORF and the Cyber Security Working Group receive regular updates on Apollos information technology, cybersecurity risk profile and strategy, and risk mitigation plans from the Companys risk management professionals, the Companys Chief Security Officer (CSO), CISO, other members of management and relevant management committees and working groups. The Cyber Security Working Group is chaired by the CISO and has representation from 60 Table of Contents Technology, Legal, Compliance, and ERM. The group meets at least once a quarter to discuss cybersecurity and risk mitigation activities, among other topics. The CISO regularly reports to the ORF regarding cyber risk, and the ORF in turn reports to the AGRC on a quarterly basis, noting any cyber updates when necessary or appropriate. In turn, the Board and/or the AGM Audit Committee receive quarterly risk updates from our risk management professionals, as well as at least annual updates on cyber risk specifically. The full AGM board or the AGM Audit Committee receives presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks from AGMs CSO or CISO, as well as from AHLs CISO, at least annually, and they address a wide range of topics including recent developments, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to the Companys peers and third parties. In our retirement services business, our board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risk management is supported by the AHL board of directors, the AHL boards audit, risk, and legal and regulatory committees, the AHL management risk committee, the AHL management operational risk committee and AHL management. AHLs Chief Information Officer (CIO), CISO, General Counsel and certain other members of AHLs senior management meet periodically with the audit, risk, and legal and regulatory committees of AHLs board of directors to review AHLs information technology and cybersecurity risk profile and to discuss risk mitigation plans. Apollo and Athene Cyber teams coordinate with and leverage one another across a number of areas. The CISOs meet regularly to discuss cyber-related risks, programs and projects. Other members of Apollo and Athenes Cyber teams meet as needed on a variety of topics and open lines of communications are present to allow for the information sharing across the retirement services and asset management businesses. Asset Management The AGM CISO, in coordination with Technology and ERM, works collaboratively across the Company to implement a program designed to protect the Companys information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Companys incident response and recovery plans. To facilitate the success of the Companys cybersecurity risk management program, multidisciplinary teams throughout the Company are deployed to address cybersecurity threats and to respond to cybersecurity incidents. Through ongoing communications with these teams, the CISO monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents in real time and reports such threats and incidents to the AGM Audit Committee or AGM board, as appropriate. AGMs CSO holds an undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems and Business Administration, which he received magna cum laude. He has over 25 years of cyber-related experience, having served in various roles in technology and cybersecurity, including as Head of IT Risk Management, Executive Director of IT & Risk Compliance, and Global IT Risk Evaluation Lead at large financial institutions and consulting firms. He was also previously AGMs CISO for nearly eight years. AGMs CISO holds a masters degree in Business Information Systems and has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 25 years across a number of large financial institutions, including as Director, Cybersecurity and Risk. Retirement Services AHLs information security program is managed by its CISO with collaboration across lines of businesses and corporate functions. AHLs CISO is a senior-level executive responsible for establishing and executing AHLs information security strategy, including cybersecurity oversight. AHLs information security program implements a detailed cyber incident response plan that provides controls and procedures for handling cyber incidents and incorporates a cross-functional approach to addressing cyber risk, with engagement among internal working groups.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 62 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol APO. The number of holders of record of our common stock as of February 23, 2024 was 293. This does not include the number of stockholders that hold stock in street name through banks or broker-dealers. Stock Performance Graph The following graph depicts the total return to holders of our common stock from the closing price on December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2023, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index. The graph assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2018 and dividends received reinvested in the security or index. The performance graph is not intended to be indicative of future performance. The performance graph shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of the Companys filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Dividend Policy The quarterly cash dividend previously paid to our common stockholders can be found in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. We have also declared a cash dividend of $0.43 per share of common stock in respect to the fourth quarter of 2023 which will be paid on February 29, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2024. Our current intention is to pay an annual cash dividend of $1.85 per share of common stock. We have also declared and set aside for payment a cash dividend of $0.8438 per share of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which will be paid on April 30, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2024. The declaration and payment of any dividends on our common stock or Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may change the dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to eliminate the dividend on common stock entirely, and will depend upon many factors, including general economic and business 63 Table of Contents conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Because AGM is a holding company, the primary source of funds for AGMs dividends are distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL. Furthermore, the ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions and making prior distributions on the AHL outstanding preferred stock, and the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will conti

icable law with respect to such distributions. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Common Shares Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain.  Under the DGCL we may only pay dividends to our stockholders out of (i) our surplus, as defined and computed under the provisions of the DGCL or (ii) our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Subject to the rights of the holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and any other preferred shares and applicable law, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, declare, make and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Instruments governing indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries incur in the future may contain restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other cash distributions to equity holders. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities On November 15, 2023, the Company issued 33,806 restricted shares under the 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan for Estate Planning Vehicles and 3,469 restricted shares under the 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan to certain holders of vested performance fee rights. The shares were issued in private placements in reliance on Regulation D or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 64 Table of Contents Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of shares of common stock during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023.

On February 8, 2024, the AGM board of directors terminated the Companys prior share repurchase program and approved a new share repurchase program, pursuant to which, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of shares of its common stock to opportunistically reduce the Companys share count or offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under the Companys equity incentive plans. Under the share repurchase program, repurchases may be of outstanding shares of common stock occurring from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise, as well as through reductions of shares that otherwise would have been issued to participants under the Companys Equity Plan in order to satisfy associated tax obligations. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time. The program is effective until the aggregate repurchase amount that has been approved by the AGM board of directors has been expended. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. 2 Represents repurchases of shares of common stock in order to offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under the Equity Plan including reductions of shares of common stock that otherwise would have been issued to participants under the Companys Equity Plan in order to satisfy associated tax obligations.

tents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Apollo Global Management, Inc.s consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a

ncluding those included in the section of this report entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. The highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current periods activity with those of prior periods. Target returns included in this report are presented gross and do not account for fees, expenses and taxes, which will reduce returns. Target returns are neither guarantees nor predictions or projections of future performance. There can be no assurance that target returns will be achieved or that Apollo will be successful in implementing the applicable strategy. Actual gross and net returns for funds managed by Apollo, and individual investors participating directly or indirectly in funds managed by Apollo, may vary significantly from the target returns set forth herein. General Our Businesses Founded in 1990, Apollo is a high-growth, global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider. Apollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing. These business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies. As of December 31, 2023, Apollo had a team of 4,879 employees, including 1,976 employees of Athene. Asset Management Our Asset Management segment focuses on three investing strategies: yield, hybrid and equity. We have a flexible mandate in many of the funds we manage which enables the funds to invest opportunistically across a companys capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds, accounts and other vehicles on behalf of some of the worlds most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, as well as other institutional and individual investors. As of December 31, 2023, we had total AUM of $651 billion. The yield, hybrid and equity investing strategies of our Asset Management segment reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform based on relative risk and return. As an asset manager, we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base. The amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy, liquidity profile, and, ultimately, our ability to generate returns for our clients. We also earn capital solutions fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizeable private equity franchise. After expenses, we call the resulting earnings stream Fee Related Earnings or FRE, which represents the primary performance measure for the Asset Management segment. Yield Yield is our largest asset management strategy with $480 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. Our yield strategy focuses on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets, through our origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe-yielding assets for the investors in the funds we manage. Within our yield strategy, we target 4% to 10% returns for our clients. Since inception, the total return yield fund has generated a 6% gross ROE and a 5% net ROE annualized through December 31, 2023. Hybrid Our hybrid strategy, with $62 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023, brings together our capabilities across debt and equity to seek to offer a differentiated risk-adjusted return with an emphasis on structured downside protected opportunities across asset classes. We target 8% to 15% returns within our hybrid strategy by pursuing investments in all market environments, deploying capital during both periods of dislocation and market strength, and focusing on different investing strategies and asset 66 Table of Contents classes. The flagship hybrid credit hedge fund we manage has generated an 11% gross ROE and a 7% net ROE annualized and the hybrid value funds we manage have generated a 20% gross IRR and a 15% net IRR from inception through December 31, 2023. Equity Our equity strategy manages $108 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. Our equity strategy emphasizes flexibility, complexity, and purchase price discipline to drive opportunistic-like returns for our clients throughout market cycles. Apollos equity team has experience across sectors, industries, and geographies in both private equity and real estate equity. Our control equity transactions are principally buyouts, corporate carveouts and distressed investments, while the real estate funds we manage generally transact in single asset, portfolio and platform acquisitions. Within our equity strategy, we target returns above 15% in the funds we manage. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in the traditional private equity funds we manage, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2023. Retirement Services Our retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athenes primary product line is annuities, which include fixed, payout and group annuities issued in conjunction with pension group annuity transactions. Athene also offers funding agreements, which are comprised of funding agreements issued under its FABN and FABR programs, funding agreements issued to the FHLB and repurchase agreements with an original maturity exceeding one year. Our asset management business provides a full suite of services for Athenes investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Our retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with Athenes preferred risk and return characteristics. Athenes investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk and capitalize on its long-dated, persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. A cornerstone of Athenes investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business, modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance. Because Athene maintains discipline in underwriting attractively priced liabilities, it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high-quality assets to generate attractive earnings. Principal Investing Our Principal Investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income, realized investment income from our balance sheet investments, and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company. The Principal Investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at AGM. Over time, we may deploy capital into strategic investments over time that will help accelerate the growth of our Asset Management segment, by broadening our investment management and/or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations. We believe these investments may translate into greater compounded annual growth of Fee Related Earnings. Given the cyclical nature of performance fees, earnings from our Principal Investing segment, or PII, are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. We earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees, primarily investment professionals, with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time. To enhance this alignment, we have increased the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over the last few years. 67 Table of Contents The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure: Note: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. (1) Includes direct and indirect ownership by AGM. Business Environment Economic and Market Conditions Our asset management and retirement services businesses are affected by the condition of global financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity, foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates and global inflation, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the performance of our business, including, but not limited to, the valuation of investments, including those of the funds we manage, and related income we may recognize. Adverse economic conditions may result from domestic and global economic and political developments, including plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions or military action, such as the armed conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia, and corresponding sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains. We carefully monitor economic and market conditions that could potentially give rise to global market volatility and affect our business operations, investment portfolios and derivatives, which includes global inflation. The global financial system experienced increased volatility in 2023 due to the failure of certain financial institutions, primarily U.S. regional banks. The current macroeconomic environment, recent bank failures and consolidations, changes in business and consumer behavior and other events affecting financial institutions, have also contributed to volatility in the commercial real estate market, and concerns regarding commercial real estate liquidity, financing availability and asset values, particularly in the office subsector. The potential impacts of rising interest rates and continued deposit outflows on global markets, financial institutions and macroeconomic conditions, generally, remain uncertain. Episodes of increased economic and market volatility may continue to occur and could worsen if there are additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures.

r economic conditions and commercial real estate, see the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report. 68 Table of Contents U.S. inflation eased but remained modestly elevated in 2023 as the U.S. Federal Reserve continued its interest rate hiking cycle, given the Consumer Price Index (CPI) persisted above the 2% target. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the annual U.S. inflation rate decreased to 3.4% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 6.5% as of December 31, 2022, following action from the U.S. Federal Reserve to temper inflation. The heightened U.S. inflation rate persists due to a combination of supply and demand factors. The U.S. Federal Reserve finished the year with a benchmark interest rate target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, unchanged from its July 2023 meeting. Equity market performance rallied in 2023. In the U.S., the S&P 500 Index increased by 24.2% in 2023, following a decrease of 19.4% in 2022. Global equity markets increased similarly in 2023, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index increasing by 18.6%, following a decrease of 13.8% in 2022. Conditions in the credit markets also have a significant impact on our business. Volatility in the bond market remained, however credit-sensitive debt and high yield bonds performed well in 2023. Credit markets were positive in 2023, with the BofAML HY Master II Index increasing by 13.5%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index increased by 13.1%. In terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.5% in 2023, following an increase of 1.9% in 2022. As of January 2024, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 2.1% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate increased to 3.7% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 3.5% as of December 31, 2022. Foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of the funds we manage that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar weakened in 2023 compared to the euro and the British pound. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the euro appreciated 3.1% in 2023, after depreciating 5.9% in 2022, while the British pound appreciated 5.4% during 2023, after depreciating 10.7% in 2022. Oil finished 2023 down 10.7% from 2022, after spiking in October in the wake of geopolitical risks. We are actively monitoring the developments in Ukraine resulting from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the economic sanctions and restrictions imposed against Russia, Belarus, and certain Russian and Belarussian entities and individuals. The Company continues to (i) identify and assess any exposure to designated persons or entities across the Companys business; (ii) ensure existing surveillance and controls are calibrated to the evolving sanctions; and (iii) ensure appropriate levels of communication across the Company, and with other relevant market participants, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2023, the funds we manage have no investments that would cause Apollo or any Apollo managed fund to be in violation of current international sanctions, and we believe the direct exposure of investment portfolios of the funds we manage to Russia and Ukraine is insignificant. The Company and the funds we manage do not intend to make any new material investments in Russia, and have appropriate controls in place to ensure review of any new exposure. Institutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers in search of more attractive returns, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities. Interest Rate Environment Rates decreased during the fourth quarter of 2023, but ended the year flat, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at 3.88% at the end of the year. The U.S. 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield curves remain inverted. Despite the magnitude of the inversion having decreased recently, recessionary concerns remain. With respect to Retirement Services, Athenes investment portfolio consists predominantly of fixed maturity investments. If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe the yield on Athenes new investment purchases may also rise and its investment income from floating rate investments would increase, while the value of its existing investments may decline. If prevailing interest rates were to decline significantly, the yield on Athenes new investment purchases may decline and its investment income from floating rate investments would decrease, while the value of its existing investments may increase. Athene addresses interest rate risk through managing the duration of the liabilities it sources with assets it acquires through asset liability management (ALM) modeling. As part of its investment strategy, Athene purchases floating rate investments, which are expected to perform well in a rising interest rate environment and are expected to underperform in a declining rate environment. As of December 31, 2023, Athenes net invested asset portfolio included $42.5 billion of floating rate 69 Table of Contents investments, or 20% of its net invested assets, and its net reserve liabilities included $17.7 billion of floating rate liabilities at notional, or 8% of its net invested assets, resulting in $24.8 billion of net floating rate assets, or 12% of its net invested assets. If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe Athenes products would be more attractive to consumers and its sales would likely increase. If prevailing interest rates were to decline, it is likely that Athenes products would be less attractive to consumers and its sales would likely decrease. In periods of prolonged low interest rates, the net investment spread may be negatively impacted by reduced investment income to the extent that Athene is unable to adequately reduce policyholder crediting rates due to policyholder guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates or otherwise due to market conditions. A significant majority of Athenes deferred annuity products have crediting rates that it may reset annually upon renewal, following the expiration of the current guaranteed period. While Athene has the contractual ability to lower these crediting rates to the guaranteed minimum levels, its willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. See Part IIItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, which includes a discussion regarding interest rate and other significant risks and our strategies for managing these risks. Overview of Results of Operations Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Asset Management The following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on Apollos asset management business as of December 31, 2023. Revenues Management Fees The significant growth of the assets we manage has had a positive effect on our revenues. Management fees are typically calculated based upon any of net asset value, gross assets, adjusted par asset value, adjusted costs of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, invested capital, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders equity, each as defined in the applicable limited partnership agreement and/or management agreement of the unconsolidated funds or accounts. Advisory and Transaction Fees, Net As a result of providing advisory services with respect to actual and potential investments, we are entitled to receive fees for transactions related to the acquisition and, in certain instances, disposition and financing of companies, some of which are portfolio companies of the funds we manage, as well as fees for ongoing monitoring of portfolio company operations and directors fees. We also receive advisory fees for advisory services provided to certain funds. In addition, monitoring fees are generated on certain structured portfolio company investments. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage (up to 100%) of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable broken deal costs (Management Fee Offset). Such amounts are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees, net, in the consolidated statements of operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on advisory and transaction fees, net). Performance Fees The general partners of the funds we manage are entitled to an incentive return of normally up to 20% of the total returns of a funds capital, depending upon performance of the underlying funds and subject to preferred returns and high water marks, as applicable. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are accounted for as an equity method investment, and effectively, the performance fees for any period are based upon an assumed liquidation of the funds assets at the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds allocation provisions. Performance fees categorized as incentive fees, which are not accounted for as an equity method investment, are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. The majority of performance fees are comprised of performance allocations. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 43% of the value of the investments of the funds we manage, on a gross basis, was determined using market-based valuation methods ( i.e. , reliance on broker or listed exchange quotes) and the remaining 57% was determined primarily by comparable company and industry multiples or discounted cash flow models. See Item 1A. Risk 70 Table of Contents FactorsRisks Relating to Our Asset Management Business The performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and the industries in which the funds we manage invest for discussion regarding certain industry-specific risks that could affect the fair value of certain of the portfolio company investments of the funds we manage. In certain funds we manage, generally in our equity strategy, the Company does not earn performance fees until the investors have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital (including management fees and expenses) in excess of an 8% hurdle rate. Additionally, certain of the yield and hybrid funds we manage have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates. Certain of the yield and hybrid funds we manage allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the equity funds. In certain funds we manage, as long as the investors achieve their priority returns, there is a catch-up formula whereby the Company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the Companys performance fees equate to its performance fee rate for that fund; thereafter, the Company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a funds cumulative investment returns. The Company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the Apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a funds life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund.

The fair value gain on investments and income at the fund level needed to reverse the general partner obligations was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. 2 As of December 31, 2023, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII and Fund VII were valued at 105% and 113% of the funds unreturned capital, respectively, which were below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the funds are required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. As of December 31, 2023, Fund VIII and Fund VII had $67.5 million and $71.2 million of gross performance fees, respectively, or $37.0 million and $40.6 million net of profit sharing, respectively, in escrow. With respect to Fund VIII and Fund VII, realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the funds partnership agreements. Performance fees receivable as of December 31, 2023 and realized performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 include interest earned on escrow balances that is not subject to contingent repayment. 3 Other includes certain SIAs. 4 There was a corresponding profit sharing payable of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, including profit sharing payable related to amounts in escrow and contingent consideration obligations of $67.1 million. The general partners of cert ain of the funds we manage accrue performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investors investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investments, which we refer to as high water marks. These high water 71 Table of Contents marks are applied on an individual investor basis. Certain of the funds we manage have investors with various high water marks, the achievement of which is subject to market conditions and investment performance. Performance fees from certain funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. These general partner obligations, if applicable, are included in due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Certain funds are denominated in pounds sterling and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1.00 to $1.27 as of December 31, 2023. 2 Amounts in Distributed by Fund and Recognized for the Citi Property Investors (CPI), Gulf Stream Asset Management, LLC (Gulf Stream), Stone Tower Capital LLC and its related companies (Stone Tower) funds and SIAs are presented for activity subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. Amounts exclude certain performance fees from business development companies and Redding Ridge Holdings LP (Redding Ridge Holdings), an affiliate of Redding Ridge. 3 Amounts were computed based on the fair value of fund investments on December 31, 2023. Performance fees have been allocated to and recognized by the general partner. Based on the amount allocated, a portion is subject to potential reversal or, to the extent applicable, has been reduced by the general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees at December 31, 2023. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of the funds investments based on contractual termination of the fund. 4 Represents the amount of performance fees that would be reversed if remaining fund investments became worthless on December 31, 2023. Amounts subject to potential reversal of performance fees include amounts undistributed by a fund ( i.e. , the performance fees receivable), as well as a portion of the amounts that have been distributed by a fund, net of taxes and not subject to a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees, except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds governing documents. 5 Other includes certain SIAs. Expenses Compensation and Benefits The most significant expense in our asset management business is compensation and benefits expense. This consists of fixed salary, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non-cash equity-based awards. Our compensation arrangements with certain employees contain a significant performance-based incentive component. Therefore, as our net revenues increase, our compensation costs rise. Our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds. 72 Table of Contents In addition, certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds we manage. Profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of performance fees. Certain of our performance-based incentive arrangements provide for compensation based on realized performance fees which includes fees earned by the general partners of the funds we manage under the applicable fund limited partnership agreements based upon transactions that have closed or other rights to incentive income cash that have become fixed in the applicable calendar year period. Profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors. Therefore, changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense. Profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increase. Realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously. If losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized, the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds. This general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated, which generally occurs at the end of the funds term. However, indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to Fund IV, Fund V and Fund VI, which, although our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners would remain personally liable, may indemnify our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for 17.5% to 100% of the previously distributed profits regardless of the funds future performance. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Companys indemnification liability. The Company grants equity awards to certain employees, including RSUs and restricted shares of common stock, that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the award terms. In some instances, vesting of an RSU is also subject to the Companys receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity-based compensation. Other expenses The balance of our other expenses includes interest, placement fees, and general, administrative and other operating expenses. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the 2024 Senior Notes, the 2026 Senior Notes, the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2030 Senior Notes, the 2033 Senior Notes, the 2048 Senior Notes, the 2050 Subordinated Notes and the 2053 Subordinated Notes as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Placement fees are incurred in connection with our capital raising activities. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract, and amortized over the life of the customer contract. General, administrative and other expenses includes occupancy expense, depreciation and amortization, professional fees and costs related to travel, information technology and administration. Occupancy expense represents charges related to office leases and associated expenses, such as utilities and maintenance fees. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is normally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to sixteen years, taking into consideration any residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized based on the future cash flows over the expected useful lives of the assets. Other Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net unrealized gains (losses) are a result of changes in the fair value of unrealized investments and reversal of unrealized gains (losses) due to dispositions of investments during the reporting period. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the assumptions that drive these models and the actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values obtained based on the use of those models. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of investment company holdings and their underlying portfolios in our consolidated financial statements. 73 Table of Contents Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses subsequent to consolidation are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Income (Losses), Net Other income (losses), net includes gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Retirement Services The following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on the Companys retirement services business, which is operated by Athene, as of December 31, 2023. Revenues Premiums Premiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Insurance revenues are reported net of reinsurance ceded. Product charges Revenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period. Net investment income Net investment income is a significant component of Athenes total revenues. Athene recognizes investment income as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest. Investment related gains (losses) Investment related gains (losses) primarily consist of (i) realized gains and losses on sales of investments, (ii) unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships, (iii) gains and losses on trading securities, (iv) gains and losses on equity securities, (v) changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and derivatives not designated as a hedge, (vi) changes in the fair value of mortgage loan assets and (vii) allowance for expected credit losses recorded through the provision for credit losses. Expenses Interest sensitive contract benefits Universal life-type policies and investment contracts include traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed and index-linked variable annuities in the accumulation phase, funding agreements, immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which include pension group annuities without life contingencies), universal life insurance, and other investment contracts inclusive of assumed endowments without significant mortality risk. Liabilities for traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities, funding agreements and universal life insurance are carried at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic which is carried at fair value. Fixed indexed annuity, index-linked variable annuity and indexed universal life insurance contracts contain an embedded derivative. Benefit reserves for these contracts are reported as the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. Liabilities for immediate annuities without 74 Table of Contents significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest rates. Certain contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit. See Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses below for further information. Changes in interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. Future policy and other policy benefits Athene issues contracts classified as long-duration, which include term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which include pension group annuities with life contingencies). Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected, referred to as the net premium ratio. Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses, longevity, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other policyholder behavior. The liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows. Changes in the value of the liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts due to changes in the discount rate are recognized as a component of OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the liability for the remeasurement gains or losses and all other changes in the liability are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Future policy benefits include liabilities for no-lapse guarantees on universal life insurance and fixed indexed universal life insurance. Each reporting period, expected excess benefits and assessments are updated with actual excess benefits and assessments and the liability balance is adjusted due to the OCI effects of unrealized investment gains and losses on AFS securities. Changes in the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees, other than the adjustment for the OCI effects of unrealized investment gains and losses on AFS securities, are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses Market risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athenes deferred annuity contracts contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset, which are included in market risk benefits or other assets, respectively, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees and assessments collectible from the policyholder at contract inception are allocated to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. If the fees are sufficient to cover the projected benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used. If the fees are insufficient to cover the projected benefits, an option-based valuation model is used to compute the market risk benefit liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits are recorded in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, excluding portions attributed to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, which are recorded in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Ceded market risk benefits are measured at fair value and recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, and value of business acquired Costs related directly to the successful acquisition of new, or the renewal of existing, insurance or investment contracts are deferred. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder 75 Table of Contents account balances, and are included in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Deferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type and amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. The cohorts and assumptions used for the amortization of deferred costs are consistent with those used in estimating the related liabilities for these contracts. Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method amortizes the deferred costs by discounting the future liability cash flows at a break-even rate. The break-even rate is solved for such that the present value of future liability cash flows is equal to the net liability at the inception of the contract. VOBA associated with acquired contracts can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions that impact VOBA amortization are consistent with those that impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities. Amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA is included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of operations. Policy and other operating expenses Policy and other operating expenses include normal operating expenses, policy acquisition expenses, interest expense, dividends to policyholders, integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses, and stock compensation expenses. Other Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Companys income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Non-Controlling Interests For entities that are consolidated, but not 100% owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than Apollo. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests primarily include limited partner interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs. Prior to the Mergers on January 1, 2022, the non-controlling interests relating to Apollo Global Management, Inc. also included the ownership interest in the Apollo Operating Group held by the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners through their limited partner interests in AP Professional Holdings, L.P. and the non-controlling interest in the Apollo Operating Group held by Athene. The authoritative guidance for non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements requires reporting entities to present non-controlling interest as equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and non-controlling interests. According to the guidance, (1) non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition, (2) net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest holders on the Companys consolidated statements of operations, (3) the primary components of non-controlling interest are separately presented in the Companys consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity to clearly distinguish the interests in the Apollo Operating Group and other ownership interests 76 Table of Contents in the consolidated entities and (4) profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests regardless of their basis.

A discussion of our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2023 (the 2022 Annual Report). Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 In this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023 and references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022. Asset Management Revenues Revenues were $3,507 million in 2023, an increase of $738 million from $2,769 million in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in management fees, investment income, and advisory and transaction fees, net. Management fees increased by $269 million to $1,772 million from $1,503 million in 2022. The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from the net impact of the commencement of Fund Xs fees and the fee basis step-down of Fund IX from committed to remaining invested capital, which added net fees of $131 million, inclusive of Fund X catch-up fees of $45 million in 2023, and an increase in management fees earned from ISGI advised clients of $21 million. Additionally, management fees also benefited from increases in fees earned from ADS of $24 million and ADREF and ADCF of $24 million. The increases in management fees earned from ADS, ADREF and ADCF were driven by higher fee-generating AUM and the acquisition of the Griffin Capital U.S. asset management business, respectively. Investment income increased $236 million in 2023 to $1,032 million compared to $796 million in 2022. The increase in investment income of $236 million in 2023 was driven by an increase in performance allocations of $310 million, partially offset by a decrease in principal investment income of $74 million. Significant drivers for performance allocations in 2023 were performance allocations primarily earned from Fund IX, Credit Strategies, Freedom Parent Holdings, L.P. and Redding Ridge Holdings of $759 million, $87 million, $63 million and $61 million, respectively, partially offset by performance allocation losses from Fund VIII, EPF III and MidCap Financial of $145 million, $99 million and $79 million, respectively. See below for details on the respective performance allocations in 2023. The performance allocations earned from Fund IX in 2023 were primarily driven by appreciation and realization of the funds investments in the (i) media, telecom and technology and (ii) leisure sectors. The performance allocations earned from Credit Strategies in 2023 were primarily driven by the net income generated by the funds investments. 78 Table of Contents The performance allocations earned from Freedom Parent Holdings, L.P. in 2023 were primarily driven by appreciation of its investment in Wheels, Inc (Wheels), a U.S. corporate fleet lessor platform. The performance allocations earned from Redding Ridge Holdings in 2023 were primarily driven by existing and new CLO issuances, CLO contract acquisitions, new consulting contracts and accumulation of warehouse assets. The performance allocation losses from Fund VIII in 2023 were primarily driven by depreciation and realization of the funds investments in the (i) consumer services and (ii) media, telecom and technology sectors. The performance allocation losses from EPF III in 2023 were primarily driven by depreciation on its commercial and residential real estate investments. The performance allocation losses from MidCap Financial in 2023 were primarily driven by the reversal of unrealized performance allocations in connection with the modification of the performance allocation arrangement. This resulted in a realization of performance allocations and a modification to the calculation of performance allocations beginning in June 2023 to be based solely on net income. See note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Advisory and transaction fees increased by $180 million to $623 million in 2023 from $443 million in 2022. Advisory and transaction fees earned during 2023 were primarily attributable to advisory and transaction fees earned from companies in the (i) financial services, (ii) real estate, (iii) chemicals, (iv) business services and (v) manufacturing and industrial sectors. Expenses Expenses were $3,739 million in 2023, an increase of $990 million from $2,749 million in 2022, primarily due to an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $454 million driven by special fully vested grants to certain senior leaders. Additionally, there was an increase in profit sharing expense of $225 million, resulting from the corresponding higher investment income during 2023, and an increase in salary, bonus and benefits of $100 million due to an increase in headcount in 2023. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. Equity-based compensation expense, in any given period, is generally comprised of: (i) performance grants which are tied to the Companys receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods and are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable, and (ii) the impact of the 2021 one-time grants awarded to the Co-Presidents, all of which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over five years, and a portion of which also vest on the Companys achievement of FRE and SRE per share metrics. General, administrative and other expenses were $872 million in 2023, an increase of $190 million from $682 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees, higher travel and entertainment expenses, higher placement fees, an increase in technology expenses and an increase in the amortization expense from the Companys commitment asset and other intangible assets. Other Income (Loss) Other income (loss) was $273 million in 2023, a decrease of $424 million from $697 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net gains from investment activities of consolidated VIEs of $364 million and a decrease in net gains from investment activities of $158 million. Other income in 2022 was primarily attributable to net gains from investment activities of consolidated VIEs and income earned as a result of APSG Is deconsolidation event. Other income in 2023 was primarily attributable to interest income earned on the Companys money market funds and U.S. treasury securities, as a result of the rising interest rate environment, and derivatives gains, which were offset, in part, by losses from the liquidations of Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II and Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, special purpose acquisition companies sponsored by Apollo. See note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 79 Table of Contents Retirement Services Revenues Retirement Services revenues were $29.1 billion in 2023, an increase of $20.9 billion from $8.2 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in investment related gains (losses), an increase in net investment income, an increase in premiums, an increase in revenues of consolidated VIEs and an increase in other revenues. Investment related gains (losses) were $1.4 billion in 2023, an increase of $14.1 billion from $(12.7) billion in 2022, primarily due to the changes in the fair value of reinsurance asset s, FIA hedging derivatives, mortgage loans and trading and equity securities, as well as realized gains on AFS securities compared to realized losses in 2022 , partially offset by foreign exchange losses on derivatives. The change in fair value of reinsurance assets increased $7.5 billion, the change in fair value of mortgage loans increased $3.2 billion and the change in fair value of trading and equity securities increased $664 million, primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates in 2023 compared to an increase in 2022, credit spread tightening in 2023 compared to credit spread widening in 2022 and more favorable economics. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives increased $4.4 billion, primarily driven by the favorable performance of the indices upon which Athenes call options are based. The largest percentage of Athenes call options are based on the S&P 500 index, which increased 24.2% in 2023, compared to a decrease of 19.4% in 2022. The favorable change in net realized gains and losses on AFS securities of $1.0 billion was primarily related to foreign exchange impacts. The foreign exchange gains on AFS securities and related losses on derivatives hedging foreign denominated assets were primarily driven by the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in comparison to 2022. Foreign exchange impacts were magnified in 2023 due to the growth in foreign denominated assets. Net investment income was $12.1 billion in 2023, an increase of $3.9 billion from $8.1 billion in 2022, primarily driven by higher floating rate income, higher rates on new deployment related to the higher interest rate environment and growth in Athenes investment portfolio attributed to strong net flows during the previous twelve months. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in alternative investment income due to less favorable alternative investment performance compared to 2022 and the transfer, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, of a significant portion of Athenes alternative investments to AAA, a consolidated VIE. Premiums were $12.7 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion from $11.6 billion in 2022, primarily driven by the premium received from the execution of a whole life block reinsurance transaction in 2023, partially offset by an $844 million decrease in pension group annuity premiums compared to 2022 . Revenues of consolidated VIEs were $1.4 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.0 billion from $440 million in 2022, primarily related to unrealized gains on assets held by AAA, fewer losses on mortgage loans held in VIEs related to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates in 2023 compared to an increase in 2022 as well as credit spread tightening in 2023 compared to credit spread widening in 2022, and the consolidation of additional VIEs. Other revenues were $591 million in 2023, an increase of $619 million from $(28) million in 2022, primarily driven by the $555 million gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement. Expenses Retirement Services expenses were $23.6 billion in 2023, an increase of $10.4 billion from $13.2 billion in 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits, an increase in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses, an increase in future policy and other policy benefits, an increase in policy and other operating expenses and an increase in DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization. Athenes annual unlocking of assumptions resulted in a decrease in benefits and expenses of $22 million compared to a decrease of $94 million in 2022. The 2023 unlocking was driven by a decrease of $94 million in interest sensitive contract benefits and a decrease of $45 million in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase of $81 million in market risk benefits and an increase of $36 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA, compared to a decrease of $49 million in interest sensitive contract benefits, a decrease of $43 million in market risk benefits and a decrease of $2 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA in 2022. Interest sensitive contract benefits were $6.2 billion in 2023, an increase of $5.7 billion from $538 million in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in the change in Athenes fixed indexed annuity reserves, an increase in rates on deferred annuity and funding agreement issuances, as well as on existing floating rate funding agreements, driven by higher U.S. Treasury rates, and significant growth in Athenes deferred annuity and funding agreement blocks of business, partially offset by a favorable 80 Table of Contents change in unlocking. The change in Athenes fixed indexed annuity reserves includes the impact from changes in the fair value of FIA embedded derivatives. The increase in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives of $4.2 billion was primarily due to the performance of the equity indices to which Athenes FIA policies are linked. The largest percentage of Athenes FIA policies are linked to the S&P 500 index, which increased 24.2% in 2023, compared to a decrease of 19.4% in 2022. The change in the fair value of FIA embedded derivatives was also driven by the unfavorable change in discount rates used in Athenes embedded derivative calculations as 2023 experienced a decrease in discount rates compared to an increase in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact of rates on policyholder projected benefits. The fair value of FIA embedded derivatives unlocking in 2023 was $20 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions, while 2022 unlocking was $47 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on future account values. The negative VOBA unlocking related to Athenes interest sensitive contract liabilities in 2023 was $74 million favorable mainly due to an increase in lapse assumptions, while 2022 unlocking was $2 million favorable. Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses were $404 million in 2023, an increase of $2.1 billion from $(1.7) billion in 2022. The losses in 2023 compared to gains in 2022 were primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits as well as an unfavorable change in unlocking. The change in fair value of market risk benefits was $2.1 billion unfavorable compar ed to 2022 due to a decrease in t he risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits. This was partially offset by a favorable change in fair value of $295 million related to favorable equity market performance compared to 2022 . The market risk benefits unlocking in 2023 was $81 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions, while 2022 unlocking was $43 million favorable primarily due to lower projected claims related to the impact of higher rates. Future policy and other policy benefits were $14.4 billion in 2023, an increase of $2.0 billion from $12.5 billion in 2022, primarily driven by the $2.2 billion increase in reserves related to the execution of a whole life block reinsurance transaction in 2023, a $931 million increase in benefit payments and an increase in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability, partially offset by an $844 million decrease in pension group annuity obligation s and favorable unlocking. The change in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability was primarily due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates in 2023 compared to an increase in 2022 as well as credit spread tightening in 2023 compared to credit spread widening in 2022. Unlocking in 2023 was $45 million favorable consisting of $297 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by $252 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The net favorable unlocking primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. Policy and other operating expenses were $1.8 billion in 2023, an increase of $465 million from $1.4 billion in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense on short-term and floating rate long-term repurchase agreements and the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as an increase in general operating expenses related to growth in the business. DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization were $688 million in 2023, an increase of $244 million from $444 million in 2022 , primarily due to significant grow th in Athenes def erred annuity block of business as well as an unfavorable change in unlocking. Unlocking in 2023 was $36 million unfavorable mainly related to an increase in lapse assumptions and changes to projected interest crediting, while unlocking in 2022 was $2 million favorable. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The Companys income tax (provision) benefit totaled $923 million and $739 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change to the provision was primarily related to the increase in pretax income and a one-time deferred tax benefit recognized in 2023 due to the enactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and AHLs redomicile to the U.S. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of (16.5)% and 17.4% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The negative effective income tax rate in 2023 is primarily due to the tax benefit recognized for the Bermuda CIT. The most significant reconciling items between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate were due to the following: (i) a benefit recognized for the Bermuda CIT, (ii) a benefit recorded for AHLs redomicile to the U.S., (iii) foreign, state and local income taxes, including NYC UBT, (iv) income attributable to non-controlling interests and (v) equity-based compensation net of the limiting provisions for executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m). Although the Company experienced a decrease to its consolidated effective income tax rate due to the Bermuda CIT deferred tax assets, and could experience a material impact to its consolidated effective tax rate as these estimates are revised, the Company does not expect material impacts to its consolidated effective tax rate or earnings and results of operations as a result of utilization of the deferred tax assets, though the Company can provide no assurance that the impacts 81 Table of Contents will not be material in future years (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the Companys income tax provision). Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures We believe that the presentation of Segment Income supplements a readers understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments. Segment Income and Adjusted Net Income Segment Income is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing segments. See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment Income and managements consideration of Segment Income. We believe that Segment Income is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed above in Overview of Results of Operations that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (ANI) represents Segment Income less HoldCo interest and other financing costs and estimated income taxes. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted Net Income tax rate, Segment Income is reduced by HoldCo interest and financing costs. Income taxes on FRE and PII represents the total current corporate, local, and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollos tax receivable agreement. Income taxes on FRE and PII excludes the impacts of deferred taxes and the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement, which arise from changes in estimated future tax rates. Certain assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied FRE and PII income tax provision are similar to those used under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP relating to transaction related charges, equity-based compensation, and tax deductible interest expense are taken into account for the implied tax provision. Income Taxes on SRE represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Management believes the methodologies used to compute income taxes on FRE, SRE, and PII are meaningful to each segment and increases comparability of income taxes between periods. Fee Related Earnings, Spread Related Earnings and Principal Investing Income Fee Related Earnings, or FRE, is a component of Segment Income that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. Spread Related Earnings, or SRE, is a component of Segment Income that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility, which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses. Non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives includes the change in fair values of derivatives and embedded derivatives, non-operating change in funding agreements, change in fair value of market risk benefits, and non-operating change in liability for future policy benefits. Principal Investing Income, or PII, is a component of Segment Income that is used as a supplemental performance measure to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE, SRE, and PII. We use Segment Income, ANI, FRE, SRE and PII as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above. 82 Table of Contents Net Invested Assets In managing its business, Athene analyzes net invested assets, which does not correspond to total Athene investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of financial condition and notes thereto. Net invested assets represent the investments that directly back Athenes net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which is used to analyze the profitability of Athenes investment portfolio. Net invested assets include (a) total investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition with AFS securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. Athene includes the underlying investments supporting its assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and excludes the underlying investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in its net invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. Athene believes the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Net invested assets include Athenes proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but do not include the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests. Net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute a net investment earned rate for such period. While Athene believes net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances the understanding of the underlying drivers of its investment portfolio, it should not be used as a substitute for Athenes total investments, including related parties, presented under U.S. GAAP. Segment Analysis Discussed below are our results of operations for each of our reportable segments. They represent the segment information available and utilized by management to assess performance and to allocate resources. See note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segment reporting. Asset Management The following table presents Fee Related Earnings, the performance measure of our Asset Management segment. Years ended December 31, Total Change Percentage Change Years ended December 31, Total Change Percentage Change 2023 2022 2022 2021 (In millions) (In millions) Asset Management: Management fees - Yield $ 1,601 $ 1,416 $ 185 13.1% $ 1,416 $ 1,172 $ 244 20.8% Management fees - Hybrid 244 211 33 15.6 211 185 26 14.1 Management fees - Equity 635 507 128 25.2 507 521 (14) (2.7) Management fees 2,480 2,134 346 16.2 2,134 1,878 256 13.6 Capital solutions fees and other, net 538 414 124 30.0 414 298 116 38.9 Fee-related performance fees 146 72 74 102.8 72 57 15 26.3 Fee-related compensation (835) (754) 81 10.7 (754) (653) 101 15.5 Other operating expenses (561) (456) 105 23.0 (456) (313) 143 45.7 Fee Related Earnings (FRE) $ 1,768 $ 1,410 $ 358 25.4% $ 1,410 $ 1,267 $ 143 11.3% Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 In this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023 and references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022. FRE was $1,768 million in 2023, an increase of $358 million compared to $1,410 million in 2022. This increase was attributable to increases in all revenue line items, and primarily driven by management fees and capital solutions fees and other, net. 83 Table of Contents The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Athene of $138 million, primarily driven by higher fee-generating AUM as a result of organic growth in retirement services clients, and fundraising across a variety of asset management strategies including the tenth vintage of our flagship private equity funds, Fund X. Management fees benefited from the net impact of the commencement of Fund Xs fees and the fee basis step-down of Fund IX from committed to remaining invested capital, which added net fees of $131 million, inclusive of Fund X catch-up fees of $45 million. Capital solutions fees earned in 2023 were primarily attributable to fees earned from companies in the (i) financial services, (ii) real estate, (iii) chemicals, (iv) business services and (v) manufacturing and industrial sectors. The growth in revenues was offset, in part, by increases in other operating expenses and fee-related compensation expense associated with the re-basing of cost structure and increased headcount to support the Companys growth. Our disciplined expense growth amid decelerating hiring activity and investment spend translated into approximately 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion in 2023.

Outflows represent redemptions, other decreases in available capital and portfolio company depreciation. Realizations represent fund distributions of realized proceeds. Market activity represents gains (losses), the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other income. 2 Outflows for Total AUM include redemptions of $7.1 billion and $4.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 3 Includes foreign exchange impacts of $2.4 billion and $(6.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2023 Total AUM was $650.8 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $103.1 billion, or 18.8%, compared to $547.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The net increase was primarily driven by the Atlas transaction, growth of our retirement services AUM, and subscriptions across the platform, partially offset by distributions and redemptions. More specifically, the net increase was due to:  Net flows of $107.2 billion primarily attributable to:  an $86.4 billion increase related to the funds we manage in our yield strategy primarily consisting of (i) $37.0 billion related to the Atlas transaction, (ii) $29.6 billion related to the growth of our retirement services clients, (iii) $21.4 billion of subscriptions mostly related to the corporate credit, corporate fixed income and direct origination funds we manage, and (iv) $4.6 billion of leverage excluding the Atlas transaction; partially offsetting these increases were $(6.3) billion of redemptions primarily in the corporate credit funds we manage;  an $8.4 billion increase related to funds we manage in our hybrid strategy due to $8.5 billion of fundraising primarily across the financial credit instruments and hybrid credit funds we manage; and  a $12.4 billion increase related to funds we manage in our equity strategy due to $13.8 billion of fundraising primarily related to the traditional private equity funds we manage; partially offset by transfer activity.  Realizations of $(26.8) billion primarily attributable to:  $(13.8) billion related to funds we manage in our yield strategy, largely driven by the anticipated run-off of the investment management agreement related to Atlas;  $(6.3) billion related to funds we manage in our hybrid strategy, largely driven by distributions from the hybrid credit, financial credit instruments and illiquid opportunistic funds we manage; and  $(6.7) billion related to funds we manage in our equity strategy primarily consisting of distributions across the traditional private equity funds we manage.  Market activity of $22.7 billion primarily attributable to:  $15.4 billion related to funds we manage in our yield strategy primarily consisting of $12.2 billion related to our retirement services clients and $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion related to the corporate credit and direct origination funds we manage, respectively; partially offset by $(3.3) billion driven by Athora;  $4.0 billion related to funds we manage in our hybrid strategy related to the hybrid credit funds we manage; and  $3.4 billion related to funds we manage in our equity strategy related to the traditional private equity funds we manage. 87 Table of Contents The following tables summarize changes in Fee-Generating AUM for each of Apollos three investing strategies within the Asset Management segment: Years ended December 31, 2023 2022 Yield Hybrid Equity Total Yield Hybrid Equity Total (In millions) Change in Fee-Generating AUM 1 : Beginning of Period $ 338,821 $ 26,113 $ 47,153 $ 412,087 $ 307,306 $ 21,845 $ 39,950 $ 369,101 Inflows 109,125 5,102 9,739 123,966 81,797 9,497 19,757 111,051 Outflows 2 (48,717) (2,745) (2,220) (53,682) (36,564) (3,563) (10,215) (50,342) Net Flows 60,408 2,357 7,519 70,284 45,233 5,934 9,542 60,709 Realizations (2,582) (1,284) (1,348) (5,214) (1,300) (1,869) (2,211) (5,380) Market Activity 3 14,519 1,201 75 15,795 (12,418) 203 (128) (12,343) End of Period $ 411,166 $ 28,387 $ 53,399 $ 492,952 $ 338,821 $ 26,113 $ 47,153 $ 412,087 1 At the individual strategy level, inflows include new subscriptions, commitments, capital raised, other increases in available capital, purchases, acquisitions and portfolio company appreciation. Outflows represent redemptions, other decreases in available capital and portfolio company depreciation. Realizations represent fund distributions of realized proceeds.

Year Ended December 31, 2023 Total Fee-Generating AUM was $493.0 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $80.9 billion, or 19.6%, compared to $412.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The net increase was primarily driven by growth of our retirement services client assets, the Atlas transaction, deployment and fundraising. More specifically, the net increase was due to:  Net flows of $70.3 billion primarily attributable to:  a $60.4 billion increase related to funds we manage in our yield strategy primarily consisting of (i) a $29.6 billion increase in AUM related to the growth of our retirement services clients, (ii) $20.0 billion related to the Atlas transaction, (iii) $12.2 billion of subscriptions primarily related to the corporate credit and corporate fixed income funds we manage; partially offset by $(6.0) billion of redemptions mostly related to the corporate credit funds we manage;  a $2.4 billion increase related to funds we manage in our hybrid strategy primarily due to $1.4 billion of subscriptions largely related to the hybrid credit funds we manage and deployment; partially offset by $(0.5) billion of redemptions related to hybrid credit funds we manage; and  a $7.5 billion increase related to funds we manage in our equity strategy primarily related to $7.2 billion of subscriptions largely related to traditional private equity funds we manage.  Market activity of $15.8 billion primarily attributable to funds we manage in our yield strategy consisting of (i) $12.3 billion related to our retirement services clients and (ii) $2.8 billion related to corporate credit funds we manage; partially offset by (i) $(3.3) billion related to Athora and (ii) funds in our hybrid strategy consisting of $1.2 billion largely related to the hybrid credit funds we manage.  Realizations of $(5.2) billion across our yield, hybrid and equity strategies. Gross Capital Deployment and Uncalled Commitments Gross capital deployment represents the gross capital that has been invested by the funds and accounts we manage during the relevant period, but excludes certain investment activities primarily related to hedging and cash management functions at the Company. Gross capital deployment is not reduced or netted down by sales or refinancings, and takes into account leverage used by the funds and accounts we manage in gaining exposure to the various investments that they have made. 88 Table of Contents Uncalled commitments, by contrast, represent unfunded capital commitments that certain of the funds we manage have received from fund investors to fund future or current fund investments and expenses. Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments are indicative of the pace and magnitude of fund capital that is deployed or will be deployed, and which therefore could result in future revenues that include management fees, transaction fees and performance fees to the extent they are fee-generating. Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments can also give rise to future costs that are related to the hiring of additional resources to manage and account for the additional capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Management uses gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments as key operating metrics since we believe the results are measures of investment activities of the funds we manage. The following presents gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments (in billions): As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Apollo had $58 billion and $51 billion of dry powder, respectively, which represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment subject to the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage. These amounts exclude uncalled commitments which can only be called for fund fees and expenses and commitments from perpetual capital vehicles. 89 Table of Contents Retirement Services The following table presents Spread Related Earnings, the performance measure of our Retirement Services segment: Years ended December 31, Total Change Percentage Change 2023 2022 (In millions) Retirement Services: Fixed income and other net investment income $ 8,739 $ 5,706 $ 3,033 53.2% Alternative net investment income 864 1,206 (342) (28.4) Net investment earnings 9,603 6,912 2,691 38.9 Strategic capital management fees 72 53 19 35.8 Cost of funds (5,650) (3,755) 1,895 50.5 Net investment spread 4,025 3,210 815 25.4 Other operating expenses (481) (462) 19 4.1 Interest and other financing costs (436) (279) 157 56.3 Spread Related Earnings (SRE) $ 3,108 $ 2,469 $ 639 25.9% Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 In this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023 and references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022. Spread Related Earnings SRE was $3.1 billion in 2023, an increase of $639 million, or 26%, compared to $2.5 billion in 2022. The increase in SRE was primarily driven by higher net investment earnings, partially offset by higher cost of funds and interest and other financing costs. Net investment earnings increased $2.7 billion, primarily driven by higher floating rate income, higher rates on new deployment and $19.7 billion of growth in Athenes average net invested assets, partially offset by less favorable alternative investment performance. The less favorable alternative investment performance compared to 2022 was primarily driven by lower income from real estate funds related to home price appreciation in 2022, less favorable performance from Athenes investment in Challenger related to a share price decrease in 2023 compared to an increase in 2022, lower returns on its investments in Athora and Venerable attributable to valuation increases in 2022 and less favorable performance on its investment in Aqua Finance related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination. These impacts were partially offset by favorable performance from Athenes investment in Wheels related to an elevated growth trajectory driven by strong performance and accelerated integration post-merger, as well as favorable performance from its investment in Redding Ridge attributed to an increase in average NAV and unfavorable economics in 2022. Cost of funds increased $1.9 billion, primarily driven by higher rates on deferred annuity, funding agreement and pension group annuity issuances, as well as an increase in rates on existing floating rate funding agreements, significant growth in each of Athenes business channels and an unfavorable change in unlocking, partially offset by the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, was unfavorable $24 million primarily related to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims. This impact was partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions as well as higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, in 2022 was favorable $3 million primarily related to the impact of higher rates on future account values, partially offset by changes to projected interest crediting. Interest and other financing costs increased $157 million related to interest expense resulting from higher rates on more short-term repurchase agreements in 2023 as well as interest expense and preferred stock dividends related to Athenes debt and preferred stock issuances in the fourth quarter of 2022. 90 Table of Contents Net Investment Spread Years ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change Fixed income and other net investment earned rate 4.45 % 3.22 % 123bps Alternative net investment earned rate 7.22 % 10.42 % NM Net investment earned rate 4.61 % 3.66 % 95bps Strategic capital management fees 0.03 % 0.03 % 0bps Cost of funds (2.71) % (1.98) % (73)bps Net investment spread 1.93 % 1.71 % 22bps Net investment spread was 1.93% in 2023, an increase of 22 basis points compared to 1.71% in 2022, driven by a higher net investment earned rate, partially offset by higher cost of funds. Net investment earned rate was 4.61% in 2023, an increase of 95 basis points compared to 3.66% in 2022, primarily due to higher returns in Athenes fixed income portfolio, partially offset by less favorable performance in its alternative investment portfolio. Fixed income and other net investment earned rate was 4.45% in 2023, an increase from 3.22% in 2022, primarily driven by higher floating rate income and higher new deployment rates. A lternative net investment earned rate was 7.22% in 2023, a decrease from 10.42% in 2022, primarily driven by lower income from real estate funds related to home price appreciation in 2022, less favorable performance from Athenes investment in Challenger related to a share price decrease in 2023 compared to an increase in 2022, lower returns on its investments in Athora and Venerable attributable to valuation increases in 2022 and less favorable performance on its investment in Aqua Finance related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination.

Cost of funds was 2.71% in 2023, an increase of 73 basis points compared to 1.98% in 2022, primarily driven by higher rates on deferred annuity, funding agreement and pension group annuity issuances, as well as an increase in rates on existing floating rate funding agreements, and an unfavorable change in unlocking, partially offset by the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement. Investment Portfolio Athene had investments, including related parties and VIEs, of $259.2 billion and $212.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Athenes investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns through the disciplined management of its investment portfolio against its long-duration liabilities, coupled with the diversification of risk. The investment strategies focus primarily on a buy and hold asset allocation strategy that may be adjusted periodically in response to changing market conditions and the nature of Athenes liability profile. Athene takes advantage of its generally persistent liability profile by identifying investment opportunities with an emphasis on earning incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Athene has selected a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene also maintains holdings in floating rate and less rate-sensitive instruments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products. In addition to its fixed income portfolio, Athene opportunistically allocates approximately 5% of its portfolio to alternative investments where it primarily focuses on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments. 91 Table of Contents The following table presents the carrying values of Athenes total investments, including related parties and VIEs: As of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022 (In millions, except percentages) Carrying Value Percentage of Total Carrying Value Percentage of Total AFS securities, at fair value U.S. government and agencies $ 5,399 2.1 % $ 2,577 1.2 % U.S. state, municipal and political subdivisions 1,046 0.4 % 927 0.4 % Foreign governments 1,899 0.7 % 907 0.4 % Corporate 78,246 30.2 % 60,901 28.7 % CLO 20,207 7.8 % 16,493 7.8 % ABS 13,383 5.2 % 10,527 5.0 % CMBS 6,591 2.5 % 4,158 2.0 % RMBS 7,567 2.9 % 5,914 2.8 % Total AFS securities, at fair value 134,338 51.8 % 102,404 48.3 % Trading securities, at fair value 1,706 0.7 % 1,595 0.8 % Equity securities 1,293 0.5 % 1,487 0.7 % Mortgage loans, at fair value 44,115 17.0 % 27,454 12.9 % Investment funds 109 0.1 % 79  % Policy loans 334 0.1 % 347 0.2 % Funds withheld at interest 24,359 9.4 % 32,880 15.5 % Derivative assets 5,298 2.1 % 3,309 1.6 % Short-term investments 341 0.1 % 2,160 1.0 % Other investments 1,206 0.5 % 773 0.4 % Total investments 213,099 82.3 % 172,488 81.4 % Investments in related parties AFS securities, at fair value Corporate 1,352 0.5 % 982 0.5 % CLO 4,268 1.7 % 3,079 1.4 % ABS 8,389 3.2 % 5,760 2.7 % Total AFS securities, at fair value 14,009 5.4 % 9,821 4.6 % Trading securities, at fair value 838 0.3 % 878 0.4 % Equity securities, at fair value 318 0.1 % 279 0.1 % Mortgage loans, at fair value 1,281 0.5 % 1,302 0.6 % Investment funds 1,632 0.6 % 1,569 0.7 % Funds withheld at interest 6,474 2.5 % 9,808 4.6 % Short-term investments 947 0.4 %   % Other investments, at fair value 343 0.1 % 303 0.2 % Total related party investments 25,842 9.9 % 23,960 11.2 % Total investments including related parties 238,941 92.2 % 196,448 92.6 % Investments of consolidated VIEs Trading securities, at fair value 2,136 0.8 % 1,063 0.5 % Mortgage loans, at fair value 2,173 0.8 % 2,055 1.0 % Investment funds, at fair value 15,820 6.2 % 12,480 5.9 % Other investments, at fair value 103  % 101  % Total investments of consolidated VIEs 20,232 7.8 % 15,699 7.4 % Total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs $ 259,173 100.0 % $ 212,147 100.0 % The $47.0 billion increase in Athenes total investments, including related parties and VIEs, as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth from gross organic and inorganic inflows of $65.6 billion in excess of gross liability outflows of $33.9 billion, unrealized gains on AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $5.3 billion resulting from credit spread tightening and a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates in 2023, the reinvestment of earnings, an increase in VIE investments primarily related to contributions from third-party investors into AAA and the consolidation of additional VIEs, and an increase in derivative assets primarily related to the impact of favorable equity market performance on Athenes call options in 2023. 92 Table of Contents Athenes investment portfolio consists largely of high quality fixed maturity securities, loans and short-term investments, as well as additional opportunistic holdings in investment funds and other instruments, including equity holdings. Fixed maturity securities and loans include publicly issued corporate bonds, government and other sovereign bonds, privately placed corporate bonds and loans, mortgage loans, CMBS, RMBS, CLOs and ABS. A significant majority of Athenes AFS portfolio, 96.5% and 95.8% as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, was invested in assets considered investment grade with an NAIC designation of 1 or 2. Athene invests a portion of its investment portfolio in mortgage loans, which are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. Athene has acquired mortgage loans through acquisitions and reinsurance arrangements, as well as through an active program to invest in new mortgage loans. It invests in CMLs on income producing properties including hotels, apartments, retail and office buildings, and other commercial and industrial properties. Athenes RML portfolio primarily consists of first lien RMLs collateralized by properties located in the U.S. Funds withheld at interest represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which Athene acts as the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company. While the substantial majority of Athenes investment portfolio has been allocated to corporate bonds and structured credit products, a key component of Athenes investment strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of investment funds with attractive risk and return profiles. Athenes investment fund portfolio consists of funds or similar equity structures that employ various strategies including equity, hybrid and yield funds. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk. Athene holds derivatives for economic hedging purposes to reduce its exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. Athenes primary use of derivative instruments relates to providing the income needed to fund the annual index credits on its FIA products. Athene primarily uses fixed indexed options to economically hedge indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specific market index. 93 Table of Contents Net Invested Assets The following summarizes Athenes net invested assets: As of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022 (In millions, except percentages) Net Invested Asset Value 1 Percentage of Total Net Invested Asset Value 1 Percentage of Total Corporate $ 82,883 38.1 % $ 80,800 41.1 % CLO 20,538 9.4 % 19,881 10.1 % Credit 103,421 47.5 % 100,681 51.2 % CML 25,977 11.9 % 23,750 12.1 % RML 18,021 8.3 % 11,147 5.7 % RMBS 7,795 3.6 % 7,363 3.7 % CMBS 5,580 2.6 % 4,495 2.3 % Real estate 57,373 26.4 % 46,755 23.8 % ABS 22,202 10.2 % 20,680 10.5 % Alternative investments 11,659 5.4 % 12,079 6.1 % State, municipal, political subdivisions and foreign government 3,384 1.5 % 2,715 1.4 % Equity securities 1,727 0.8 % 1,737 0.9 % Short-term investments 1,048 0.5 % 1,930 1.0 % U.S. government and agencies 4,052 1.9 % 2,691 1.4 % Other investments 44,072 20.3 % 41,832 21.3 % Cash and equivalents 10,467 4.8 % 5,481 2.8 % Policy loans and other 2,094 1.0 % 1,702 0.9 % Net invested assets $ 217,427 100.0 % $ 196,451 100.0 % 1 See Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures for the definition of net invested assets. Athenes net invested assets were $217.4 billion and $196.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in net invested assets as of December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth from net organic inflows of $43.0 billion in excess of net liability outflows of $28.8 billion, inclusive of the impacts related to the sale of 50% of ACRA 2s economic interests to ADIP II, effective July 1, 2023, as well as an incremental 10% increase in ADIP II ownership effective December 31, 2023. In connection with the initial sale and subsequent increase in ownership, inflows attributable to ACRA 2 during the year were retroactively attributed to ADIP II based on its economic ownership. Additionally, net invested assets increased due to $2.2 billion of inorganic inflows related to a block reinsurance transaction, the reinvestment of earnings and a contribution by AGM of $1.25 billion related to the net proceeds from its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering, partially offset by cash used to pay quarterly dividends. In managing its business, Athene utilizes net invested assets as presented in the above table. Net invested assets do not correspond to Athenes total investments, including related parties, on the consolidated statements of financial condition, as discussed previously in Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures. Net invested assets represent Athenes investments that directly back its net reserve liabilities and surplus assets. Athene believes this view of its portfolio provides a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Athene adjusts the presentation for assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions to include or exclude the underlying investments based upon the contractual transfer of economic exposure to such underlying investments. Athene also adjusts for VIEs to show the net investment in the funds, which are included in the alternative investments line above as well as adjusting for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets include Athenes proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but exclude the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests. Net invested assets is utilized by management to evaluate Athenes investment portfolio. Net invested assets is used in the computation of the net investment earned rate, which allows Athene to analyze the profitability of its investment portfolio. Net invested assets is also used in Athenes risk management processes for asset purchases, product design and underwriting, stress scenarios, liquidity and ALM. 94 Table of Contents Principal Investing The following table presents Principal Investing Income, the performance measure of our Principal Investing segment.

=== ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT ===

% As described in Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneral, earnings from our Principal Investing segment are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from our Asset Management segment due to the intrinsic cyclical nature of performance fees, one of the key drivers of PII performance. Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022 In this section, references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023 and references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022. PII was $83 million in 2023, a decrease of $201 million, as compared to $284 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in realized investment income of $332 million, partially offset by an increase in realized performance fees. Realized investment income in 2023 was negatively impacted by $42 million of losses related to the liquidations of Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II and Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp, special purpose acquisition companies sponsored by Apollo. Realized investment income in 2022 was primarily attributable to realized gains earned on the transfer to Athene of certain of Apollos general partner fund co-investments that were subsequently transferred to AAA in the second quarter of 2022 and realized gains from the transfer of the Companys investment in Redding Ridge to AAA. The increase in realized performance fees of $147 million in 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in realized performance fees generated from Fund VIII and Fund IX, as well as the crystallization of annual performance fees generated from Credit Strategies Fund, partially offset by decreases in realized performance fees from HVF I and Fund V. The increase in realized performance fees in 2023 remained prudently delayed amid a challenging exit environment. Principal investing compensation expense of $601 million in 2023 increased $16 million, as compared to $585 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in profit sharing expense associated with the corresponding increase in realized performance fees and an increase in profit sharing expense subject to clawback, partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing expense attributable to the Companys incentive pool, a compensation program through which certain employees are allocated discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, and is included within principal investing compensation. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. The incentive pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period. 95 Table of Contents The Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds Below we present information relating to the historical performance of the funds we manage, including certain legacy Apollo funds that do not have a meaningful amount of unrealized investments, and in respect of which the general partner interest has not been contributed to us. When considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of funds we manage are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from such funds, from any future funds we may raise or from your investment in our common stock. An investment in our common stock is not an investment in any of the Apollo managed funds, and the assets and revenues of the funds we manage are not directly available to us. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common stock. However, poor performance of the funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the value of our common stock. Moreover, the historical returns of funds we manage should not be considered indicative of the future results you should expect from such funds or from any future funds we may raise. There can be no assurance that any Apollo fund will continue to achieve the same results in the future. Finally, our private equity IRRs have historically varied greatly from fund to fund. For example, Fund VI generated a 12% gross IRR and a 9% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2023, while Fund V generated a 61% gross IRR and a 44% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our private equity funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the

Based on managements experience, we believe that the Companys current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet the Companys anticipated expenses and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For the longer-term liquidity needs of the asset management business, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business operations through management fees and performance fees received. The principal sources of liquidity for the retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets. AGM is a holding company whose primary source of cash flow is distributions from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be sufficient to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. AGMs primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, common stock and preferred stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $15.8 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $4.9 billion of available funds from the 2022 AMH credit facility, AHL credit facility, and AHL liquidity facility. 101 Table of Contents Primary Uses of Cash Over the next 12 months, we expect the Companys primary liquidity needs will be to:  support the future growth of Apollos businesses through strategic corporate investments;  pay the Companys operating expenses, including, compensation, general, administrative, and other expenses;  make payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits;  make interest and principal payments on funding agreements;  make payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations and policy acquisition costs;  pay taxes and tax related payments;  pay cash dividends;  make payments related to the AOG Unit Payment;  repurchase common stock; and  make payments under the tax receivable agreement. Over the long term, we believe we will be able to (i) grow Apollos Assets Under Management and generate positive investment performance in the funds we manage, which we expect will allow us to grow the Companys management fees and performance fees and (ii) grow the investment portfolio of retirement services, in each case in amounts sufficient to cover our long-term liquidity requirements, which may include:  supporting the future growth of our businesses;  creating new or enhancing existing products and investment platforms;  making payments to policyholders;  pursuing new strategic corporate investment opportunities;  paying interest and principal on the Companys financing arrangements;  repurchasing common stock;  making payments under the tax receivable agreement; and  paying cash dividends. Cash Flow Analysis The section below discusses in more detail the Companys primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows within the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows: Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 2021 Operating Activities $ 6,322 $ 3,789 $ 1,064 Investing Activities (42,407) (23,444) (1,552) Financing Activities 42,638 28,710 109 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 10 (15)  Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Cash and Cash Equivalents Held at Consolidated Variable Interest Entities $ 6,563 $ 9,040 $ (379) The assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, could have a substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows. Because our consolidated funds and VIEs are generally treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, their investing cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operating activities. The table below summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flow by activity attributable to the Company and to our consolidated funds and VIEs. 102 Table of Contents Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by the Company's operating activities $ 6,519 $ 7,021 $ 2,165 Net cash used in the Consolidated Funds and VIEs operating activities (197) (3,232) (1,101) Net cash provided by operating activities 6,322 3,789 1,064 Net cash used in the Company's investing activities (39,834) (21,840) (1,229) Net cash used in the Consolidated Funds and VIEs investing activities (2,573) (1,604) (323) Net cash used in investing activities (42,407) (23,444) (1,552) Net cash provided by (used in) the Company's financing activities 42,021 23,786 (1,576) Net cash provided by the Consolidated Funds and VIEs financing activities 617 4,924 1,685 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 42,638 $ 28,710 $ 109 Operating Activities The Companys operating activities support its Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities primarily includes cash inflows from the receipt of management fees, advisory and transaction fees, realized performance revenues, and realized principal investment income, offset by cash outflows for compensation, general, administrative, other expenses and activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects operating activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs, which includes cash outflows for purchases of investments, offset by cash inflows from consolidated funds. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities support the growth of its business. The primary sources of cash within investing activities include: (a) distributions from investments and (b) sales, maturities and repayments of investments. The primary uses of cash within investing activities include: (a) capital expenditures, (b) purchases and acquisitions of new investments, including purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and (c) equity method investments in the funds we manage.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the purchase of investments due to the deployment of significant cash inflows from Athenes organic growth, partially offset by the sales, maturities and repayments of investments.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the purchase of investments due to the deployment of significant cash inflows from Athenes organic growth, partially offset by Athene cash acquired as a result of the Mergers and the sale, repayment and maturity of investments. 103 Table of Contents  During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities primarily reflects purchases of investments in Motive Partners and Challenger Ltd., net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, and net contributions to equity method investments. Net cash used in investing activities also reflects the investing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs, which primarily includes net proceeds from maturities of U.S. Treasury securities. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities reflect its capital market transactions and transactions with equity holders. The primary sources of cash within financing activities includes: (a) proceeds from debt and preferred equity issuances, (b) inflows on Athenes investment-type policies and contracts, (c) changes of cash collateral posted for derivative transactions, (d) capital contributions, and (e) proceeds from other borrowing activities. The primary uses of cash within financing activities include: (a) dividends, (b) payments under the tax receivable agreement, (c) share repurchases, (d) cash paid to settle tax withholding obligations in connection with net share settlements of equity-based awards, (e) repayments of debt, (f) withdrawals on Athenes investment-type policies and contracts and (g) changes of cash collateral posted for derivative transactions.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects cash received from the strong organic inflows from retail, flow reinsurance and funding agreements, net of outflows, a favorable change in cash collateral posted for derivative transactions related to the favorable equity market performance in 2023, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, issuances of the 2053 Subordinated Notes, 2033 Senior Notes and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, and the issuance of debt by our subsidiary, partially offset by the redemption of the AAM Preferred Stock, the payment of stock dividends, the repayment of short-term repurchase obligations and distribution to redeemable non-controlling interest. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, offset by payments for borrowings under repurchase agreements.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects the strong organic inflows from retail and funding agreements, net of withdrawals, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, and the issuance of debt and preferred stock by our subsidiary, partially offset by the payment of stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, including repurchase agreements.

Net cash used in financing activities also reflects dividends to common stockholders, distributions to non-controlling interest holders, and repurchases of common stock. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies For a summary and a description of the nature of the Companys commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies. The Companys commitments are primarily fulfilled through cash flows from operations and financing activities. Consolidated Funds and VIEs The Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating unconsolidated cash flows; however, the Companys financial statements reflect the financial position of Apollo as well as Apollos consolidated funds and VIEs (including SPACs). The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollos consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital from their investors, which have been reflected historically as non-controlling interests of the consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations through distributions, interest and the realization of investments, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, and (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs). Dividends and Distributions For information regarding the quarterly dividends and distributions that were made to common stockholders and non-controlling interest holders in the Apollo Operating Group and participating securities, see note 17 to the consolidated financial 104 Table of Contents statements. Although the Company currently expects to pay dividends, we may not pay dividends if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the dividends. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we may have to borrow funds to pay dividends, or we may determine not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our dividends are at the sole discretion of the AGM board of directors. Because AGM is a holding company, the primary source of funds for AGMs dividends is distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, which are expected to be adequate to fund AGMs dividends and other cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. The ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions, including surplus and minimum solvency requirements among others, as well as making prior distributions on AHL outstanding preferred stock. Moreover, the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. On February 8, 2024, AGM declared a cash dividend of $0.43 per share of its common stock, which will be paid on February 29, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2024. On February 8, 2024, the Company also declared and set aside a cash dividend of $0.8438 per share of its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which will be paid on April 30, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2024. Repurchase of Securities Share Repurchase Program For information regarding the Companys share repurchase program, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Repurchase of Other Securities We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our other outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase any of our other securities and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On August 11, 2023, the Company issued 28,750,000 shares, or $1.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference, of its 6.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Asset Management Liquidity Our asset management business requires limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of the business. For the asset management business longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business operations through management fees and performance fees received. Liquidity needs are also met (to a limited extent) through proceeds from borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. From time to time, if the Company determines that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise proceeds through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments. AGM has a registration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2023, the asset management business had $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1.0 billion of available funds from the 2022 AMH credit facility. 105 Table of Contents Future Debt Obligations The asset management business had short-term and long-term debt of $0.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, which includes notes with maturities in 2024, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2033, 2048, 2050 and 2053. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business debt arrangements. Future Cash Flows Our ability to execute our business strategy, particularly our ability to increase our AUM, depends on our ability to establish new funds and to raise additional investor capital within such funds. Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, which is highly dependent on the funds we manage and our ability to manage our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends. Also during economic downturns the funds we manage might experience cash flow issues or liquidate entirely. In these situations we might be asked to reduce or eliminate the management fee and performance fees we charge, which could adversely impact our cash flow in the future. An increase in the fair value of the investments of the funds we manage, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity through higher management fees where the management fees are calculated based on the net asset value, gross assets or adjusted assets. Additionally, higher performance fees not yet realized would generally result when investments appreciate over their cost basis which would not have an impact on the asset management business cash flow until realized. Consideration of Financing Arrangements As noted above, in limited circumstances, the asset management business may issue debt or equity to supplement its liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after careful consideration of various factors, including the asset management business cash flows from operations, future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the asset management business debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates. Revolver Facility Under the 2022 AMH credit facility, AMH may borrow in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.0 billion and may incur incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million plus additional amounts so long as AMH is in compliance with a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the 2022 AMH credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, permitted acquisitions. The 2022 AMH credit facility has a final maturity date of October 12, 2027. Tax Receivable Agreement The tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM and its subsidiaries realize subject to the agreement. For more information regarding the tax receivable agreement, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. AOG Unit Payment On December 31, 2021, holders of AOG Units (other than Athene and Apollo) sold and transferred a portion of such AOG Units to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for an amount equal to $3.66 multiplied by the total number of AOG Units held by such holders immediately prior to such transaction (such payment, the AOG Unit Payment). The remainder of the AOG Units held by such holders were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers on January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding AOG Unit Payment amount was $175 million, payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2024. See note 19 for more information. 106 Table of Contents Athora Athora is a strategic liabilities platform that acquires and reinsures traditional closed life insurance policies and provides capital and reinsurance solutions to insurers in Europe. In 2017, an AAM subsidiary made a 125 million commitment to Athora, which was fully drawn as of April 2020. An AAM subsidiary committed an incremental 58 million in 2020 to purchase new equity interests. Additionally, in 2021, an AAM subsidiary acquired approximately 21.9 million of new equity interests in Athora. In December 2021, an AAM subsidiary committed an additional 250 million to purchase new equity interests to support Athoras ongoing growth initiatives, of which 180 million was drawn as of December 31, 2023. An AAM subsidiary and Athene are minority investors in Athora with a long-term strategic relationship. Through its share ownership, the AAM subsidiary has approximately 19.9% of the total voting power in Athora, and Athene holds shares in Athora representing 10% of the total voting power in Athora. In addition, Athora shares held by funds and other accounts managed by Apollo represent, in the aggregate, approximately 15.1% of the total voting power in Athora. Fund Escrow As of December 31, 2023, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII and Fund VII were valued at 105% and 113% of the funds unreturned capital, respectively, which were below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the funds are required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. Realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per each funds respective partnership agreement. Clawback Performance fees from certain of the funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. See Overview of Results of OperationsPerformance Fees for the maximum performance fees subject to potential reversal by each fund. Indemnification Liability The asset management business recorded an indemnification liability in the event that the Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain investment professionals are required to pay amounts in connection with a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees. See note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business indemnification liability. Retirement Services Liquidity There are two forms of liquidity relevant to our retirement services business: funding liquidity and balance sheet liquidity. Funding liquidity relates to the ability to fund operations. Balance sheet liquidity relates to the ability to liquidate or rebalance Athenes balance sheet without incurring significant costs from fees, bid-offer spreads, or market impact. Athene manages its liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets. The principal sources of liquidity for our retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets. Athenes investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices. In general, liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, highly rated bonds, short-term investments, unaffiliated preferred stock and public common stock, all of which generally have liquid markets with a large number of buyers. Assets included in modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios are available to fund the benefits for the associated obligations but are restricted from other uses. Although the investment portfolio of our retirement services business does contain assets that are generally considered illiquid for liquidity monitoring purposes (primarily mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, investment funds and affiliated common stock), there is some ability to raise cash from these assets if needed. On June 30, 2023, Athene entered into a new AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility, which replaced its previous facilities. Athene has access to liquidity through the AHL credit 107 Table of Contents facility with a borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion, subject to being increased up to $1.75 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL credit facility, the AHL liquidity facility with a borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion, subject to being increased up to $3.1 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL liquidity facility, and $2.0 billion of committed repurchase facilities. Both the AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility were undrawn as of December 31, 2023. Athene has a registration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. Athene is also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which it may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. In addition, through Athenes membership in the FHLB, it is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. Athene proactively manages its liquidity position to meet cash needs while minimizing adverse impacts on investment returns. Athene analyzes its cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the provisions of its policies and contracts in force, its cash flow position, and the volume of cash and readily marketable securities in its portfolio. Liquidity risk is monitored, managed and mitigated through a number of stress tests and analyses to assess Athenes ability to meet its cash flow requirements, as well as the ability of its reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to meet their collateral obligations, under various stress scenarios. Athene further seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining access to alternative, external sources of liquidity. Insurance Subsidiaries Operating Liquidity The primary cash flow sources for Athenes insurance subsidiaries include retirement services product inflows (premiums and deposits), investment income, principal repayments on its investments, net transfers from separate accounts and financial product inflows. Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements, payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations, policy acquisition costs and general operating costs, and payment of cash dividends. Athenes policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature. However, policyholders may elect to withdraw some, or all, of their account value in amounts that exceed Athenes estimates and assumptions over the life of an annuity contract. Athene includes provisions within its annuity policies, such as surrender charges and MVAs, which are intended to protect it from early withdrawals. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 79% and 76%, respectively, of Athenes deferred annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 64% and 60%, respectively, of policies contained MVAs that may also have the effect of limiting early withdrawals if interest rates increase, but may encourage early withdrawals by effectively subsidizing a portion of surrender charges when interest rates decrease. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 28% of Athenes net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, including buy-out pension group annuities other than those that can be withdrawn as lump sums, funding agreements and payout annuities, while 56% were subject to penalty upon surrender. Membership in Federal Home Loan Bank Through its membership in the FHLB, Athene is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. The borrowings must be secured by eligible collateral such as mortgage loans, eligible CMBS or RMBS, government or agency securities and guaranteed loans. As of each of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements. Athene has issued funding agreements to the FHLB. These funding agreements were issued in an investment spread strategy, consistent with other investment spread operations. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene had funding agreements outstanding with the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of $6.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The maximum FHLB indebtedness by a member is determined by the amount of collateral pledged and cannot exceed a specified percentage of the members total statutory assets dependent on the internal credit rating assigned to the member by the FHLB. As of December 31, 2023, Athenes total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to $43.1 billion. However, Athenes ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the facilities and certain other limitations. Considering these limitations, as of December 31, 2023 Athene had the ability to draw up to an estimated $10.2 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding. This estimate is based on Athenes internal analysis and assumptions and may not accurately measure collateral which is ultimately acceptable to the FHLB. 108 Table of Contents Securities Repurchase Agreements Athene engages in repurchase transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. Athene requires that, at all times during the term of the repurchase agreements, it maintains sufficient cash or other liquid assets sufficient to allow it to fund substantially all of the repurchase price. Proceeds received from the sale of securities pursuant to these arrangements are generally invested in short-term investments or maintained in cash, with the offsetting obligation to repurchase the security included within payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As per the terms of the repurchase agreements, Athene monitors the market value of the securities sold and may be required to deliver additional collateral (which may be in the form of cash or additional securities) to the extent that the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the payables for repurchase agreements were $3.9 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, while the fair value of securities and collateral held by counterparties backing the repurchase agreements was $4.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, payables for repurchase agreements were comprised of $686 million of short-term and $3.2 billion of long-term repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, payables for repurchase agreements were comprised of $1.9 billion of short-term and $2.9 billion of long-term repurchase agreements. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries AHL is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. The primary source of AHLs cash flow is dividends from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be adequate to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. The ability of AHLs insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as agreements entered into with regulators. These laws and regulations require, among other things, the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay. Subject to these limitations and prior notification to the appropriate regulatory agency, Athenes U.S. insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under insurance laws of the relevant state of domicile. Any distributions above the amount permitted by statute in any twelve-month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and require the approval of the appropriate regulator prior to payment. AHL does not currently plan on having the U.S. subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents. Dividends from AHLs subsidiaries are projected to be the primary source of AHLs liquidity. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, each of Athenes Bermuda insurance subsidiaries is prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior years statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the board of directors of the Bermuda insurance subsidiary and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the Bermuda insurance subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the Bermuda insurance subsidiary meeting its relevant margins, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA. The maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of the insurance subsidiaries actual ability to pay such distributions, which may be further restricted by business and other considerations, such as the impact of such distributions on surplus, which could affect Athenes ratings or competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written. Specifically, the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Fitch and Moodys, is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions. AHL believes its insurance subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus, combined with additional capital available to be provided by AHL, to meet their financial strength ratings objectives. Finally, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of Athenes insurance subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for the insurance subsidiaries financial needs. 109 Table of Contents Other Sources of Funding Athene may seek to secure additional funding at the AHL level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries, such as by drawing on its undrawn $1.25 billion AHL credit facility, drawing on its undrawn $2.6 billion AHL liquidity facility or by pursuing future issuances of debt or preferred stock to third-party investors. The AHL credit facility contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 35%, maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $14.8 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates and terms are as defined in the AHL credit facility. The AHL liquidity facility also contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining an ALRe minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $8.8 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates and terms are as defined in the AHL liquidity facility. Future Debt Obligations Athene had long-term debt of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, which includes notes with maturities in 2028, 2030, 2031, 2033, 2034, 2051 and 2052. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Athenes debt arrangements. Capital Athene believes it has a strong capital position and is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using an internal capital model which reflects managements view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athenes core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC RBC and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athenes U.S. RBC ratio was 392% and 387%, respectively, its Bermuda RBC ratio was 400% and 407%, respectively, and its consolidated RBC ratio was 412% and 416%, respectively. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. The RBC of Athenes Bermuda insurance companies presented herein exclude the impact of any deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the enactment of the Bermuda CIT. Athene is currently assessing deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the Bermuda CIT, which could have a positive impact on the statutory capital and surplus of its Bermuda insurance companies. ACRA ACRA 1 provided Athene with access to on-demand capital to support its growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities. ACRA 1 provided a capital source to fund both Athenes inorganic and organic channels. Similar to ACRA 1, ACRA 2 was funded in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50% of its non-voting, economic interests in ACRA 2 to ADIP II for $640 million, while maintaining all of ACRA 2s voting interests. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP IIs ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60%, with ALRe owning the remaining 40% of economic interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP IIs proportionate economic interest in ACRA 2. These strategic capital solutions allow Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results 110 Table of Contents could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are affected most by judgments, estimates and assumptions. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Overall Consolidation We consolidate entities on a variable interest or voting interest model or, if applicable, apply specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. Significant judgment may be required for the application of the VIE guidance and to determine whether entities qualify as investment companies under U.S. GAAP. The assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate requires judgment. Those judgments include, but are not limited to: (i) determining whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) evaluating whether the holders of equity investment at risk, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity, (iii) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive the expected residual returns from an entity and (iv) evaluating the nature of the relationship and activities of those related parties with shared power or under common control for purposes of determining which party within the related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE. Judgments are also made in determining whether a member in the equity group has a controlling financial interest, including power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and rights to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. This analysis considers all relevant economic interests, including proportionate interests held through related parties. Additionally, evaluating an entity to determine whether it meets the characteristics of an investment company under U.S. GAAP is qualitative in nature and may involve significant judgment. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. Equity-Based Compensation Equity-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Certain RSUs granted by the Company vest subject to continued employment and the Companys receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. Equity-based compensation expense for such awards, if and when granted, will be recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance fee metrics are met or deemed probable. The addition of these performance measures helps to promote the interests of our shareholders and fund investors by making RSU vesting contingent on the realization and distribution of profits on our funds. For more information regarding Apollos equity-based compensation awards, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The Companys assumptions made to determine the fair value on grant date are embodied in the calculations of compensation expense. A significant part of our compensation expense is derived from amortization of RSUs. The fair value of all RSU grants after March 29, 2011 is based on the grant date fair value, which considers the public share price of AGM. The Company has three types of RSU grants, which we refer to as Plan Grants, Bonus Grants, and Performance Grants. Plan Grants may or may not provide the right to receive dividend equivalents until the RSUs vest and, for grants made after 2011, the underlying shares are generally issued by March 15th after the year in which they vest. For Plan Grants, the grant date fair value is based on the public share price of the Company, and is discounted for transfer restrictions and lack of dividends until vested if applicable. Bonus Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on both vested and unvested RSUs and Performance Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on vested RSUs and may also provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. Both Bonus Grants and Performance Grants are generally issued by March 15th of the year following the year in which they vest. For Bonus Grants and Performance Grants, the grant date fair value for the periods presented is based on the public share price of AGM, and is discounted for transfer restrictions. 111 Table of Contents We utilized the present value of a growing annuity formula to calculate a discount for the lack of pre-vesting dividends on certain Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants and Performance Grants: Years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Plan Grants: Dividend Yield 1 2.1% 3.0% 3.0% Cost of Equity Capital Rate 3 13.7% 12.3% 11.7% Performance Grants: Dividend Yield 2 2.2% 2.9% 2.2% Cost of Equity Capital Rate 3 12.6% 12.3% 12.0% 1 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the price of the Companys common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis. 2 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and the price of the Companys common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis. 3 Assumes a discount rate that was equivalent to the opportunity cost of foregoing distributions on unvested Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs as of the valuation date, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM is a commonly used mathematical model for developing expected returns. We utilize the Finnerty Model to calculate a marketability discount on the Plan Grant, Bonus Grant and Performance Grant RSUs to account for the lag between vesting and issuance. The Finnerty Model provides for a valuation discount reflecting the holding period restriction embedded in a restricted security preventing its sale over a certain period of time. The Finnerty Model proposes to estimate a discount for lack of marketability such as transfer restrictions by using an option pricing theory. This model has gained recognition through its ability to address the magnitude of the discount by considering the volatility of a companys stock price and the length of restriction. The concept underpinning the Finnerty Model is that a restricted security cannot be sold over a certain period of time. Further simplified, a restricted share of equity in a company can be viewed as having forfeited a put on the average price of the marketable equity over the restriction period (also known as an Asian Put Option). If we price an Asian Put Option and compare this value to that of the assumed fully marketable underlying security, we can effectively estimate the marketability discount. The inputs utilized in the Finnerty Model are (i) length of holding period, (ii) volatility and (iii) dividend yield. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants, Bonus Grants and Performance Grants: Years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Plan Grants: Holding Period Restriction (in years) 4.1 1.2 4.6 Volatility 1 41.4% 44.8% 32.8% Dividend Yield 2 2.1% 3.0% 3.0% Bonus Grants: Holding Period Restriction (in years) 0.2 0.2 0.2 Volatility 1 38.5% 34.5% 34.9% Dividend Yield 2 2.3% 2.9% 3.9% Performance Grants: Holding Period Restriction (in years) 1.1 0.9 0.6 Volatility 1 41.9% 37.4% 27.0% Dividend Yield 2 2.2% 2.9% 2.2% 1 The Company determined the expected volatility based on the volatility of the Companys common stock price as of the grant date with consideration to comparable companies. 2 Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the Companys common stock price as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis. 112 Table of Contents Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions when the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Companys tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Asset Management Investments, at Fair Value On a quarterly basis, Apollo utilizes valuation committees consisting of members from senior management, to review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds it manages. The Company also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material. The fair values of the investments in the funds we manage can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models. For further discussion on the impact of changes to valuation assumptions see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskSensitivity in this report. There have been no material changes to the valuation approaches utilized during the periods that our financial results are presented in this report. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Except for the Companys debt obligations (each as defined in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements), Apollos financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. See Investments, at Fair Value above. While Apollos valuations of portfolio investments are based on assumptions that Apollo believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. Financial instruments carrying values generally approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments or variable interest rates related to the borrowings. Revenue Recognition Performance Fees Apollo earns performance fees from funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Such performance fees generally are earned based upon a fixed percentage of realized and unrealized gains of various funds after meeting any applicable hurdle rate or threshold minimum. Performance allocations are performance fees that are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital to the Company. Performance allocations from certain of the funds that we manage are subject to contingent repayment and are generally paid to us as particular investments made by the funds are realized. If, however, upon liquidation of a fund, the 113 Table of Contents aggregate amount paid to us as performance fees exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund, the excess (in certain cases net of taxes) is required to be returned by us to that fund. We account for performance allocations as an equity method investment, and accordingly, we accrue performance allocations quarterly based on fair value of the underlying investments and separately assess if contingent repayment is necessary. The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. See Investments, at Fair Value below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our yield, hybrid and equity funds. Incentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation. Incentive fees are generally received from the management of CLOs, managed accounts and MFIC. For a majority of our incentive fees, once the quarterly or annual incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment, however, certain other incentive fees can be subject to contingent repayment at the end of the life of the entity. In accordance with the revenue recognition standard, certain incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration and therefore are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed, but generally the Company will defer the revenue until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal. Management Fees Management fees related to the yield funds we manage can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders equity, all as defined in the respective partnership agreements. The management fee calculations for the yield funds we manage that consider net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments and adjusted assets are normally based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. The management fees related to equity funds we manage, by contrast, are generally based on a fixed percentage of the committed capital or invested capital. The corresponding fee calculations that consider committed capital or invested capital are both objective in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or assumptions. The management fees related to the hybrid funds we manage are generally based on net asset value, gross assets, or committed or invested capital. See Investments, at Fair Value below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in the yield, hybrid and equity funds. Profit Sharing Expense Profit sharing expense is primarily a result of agreements with employees to compensate them based on the ownership interest they have in the general partners of the Apollo funds. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in the funds we manage and advise affect profit sharing expense. Employees are generally allocated approximately 30% to 61%, of the total performance fees which is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying funds investments and is treated as compensation expense. Additionally, profit sharing expenses paid may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees to the extent not indemnified. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the Apollo funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the end of a funds life. Several of the Companys employee remuneration programs are dependent upon performance fee realizations, including the incentive pool, and dedicated performance fee rights and certain RSU awards for which vesting is contingent, in part, on the realization of performance fees in a specified period. The Company established these programs to attract and retain, and provide incentive to, partners and employees of the Company and to more closely align the overall compensation of partners and employees with the overall realized performance of the Company. Dedicated performance fee rights entitle their holders to payments arising from performance fee realizations. The incentive pool enables certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, which amounts are reflected in profit sharing expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Amounts earned by participants as a result of their performance fee rights (whether dedicated or incentive pool) will vary year-to-year depending on the overall realized performance of the Company 114 Table of Contents (and, in the case of the incentive pool, on their individual performance). There is no assurance that the Company will continue to compensate individuals through the same types of arrangements in the future and there may be periods when the Company determines that allocations of realized performance fees are not sufficient to compensate individuals, which may result in an increase in salary, bonus and benefits, the modification of existing programs or the use of new remuneration programs. Reductions in performance fee revenues could also make it harder to retain employees and cause employees to seek other employment opportunities. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Retirement Services Investments The Company is responsible for the fair value measurement of investments presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs regular analysis and review of its valuation techniques, assumptions and inputs used in determining fair value to evaluate if the valuation approaches are appropriate and consistently applied, and the various assumptions are reasonable. The Company also performs quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from commercial pricing services and broker-dealers, to verify it represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value of each investment. In addition, the Company uses both internally-developed and commercially-available cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values using credit spreads and other market assumptions, where appropriate. For investment funds, the Company typically recognizes its investment, including those for which it has elected the fair value option, based on net asset value information provided by the general partner or related asset manager. For a discussion of investment funds for which it has elected the fair value option, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 115 Table of Contents Valuation of Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Mortgage Loans The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including those with related parties and those held by consolidated VIEs, by pricing source and fair value hierarchy: December 31, 2023 (In millions, except percentages) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fixed maturity securities AFS securities Priced via commercial pricing services $ 104,100 $ 6,297 $ 97,797 $ 6 Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations 27,725  24,806 2,919 Priced via models or other methods 16,522  150 16,372 Trading securities Priced via commercial pricing services 1,241 22 1,219  Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations 464 2 435 27 Priced via models or other methods 839   839 Trading securities of consolidated VIEs 2,136  284 1,852 Total fixed maturity securities, including related parties and consolidated VIEs 153,027 6,321 124,691 22,015 Equity securities Priced via commercial pricing services 972 273 699  Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations 1   1 Priced via models or other methods 280   280 Total equity securities, including related parties 1,253 273 699 281 Mortgage loans Priced via commercial pricing services 40,801   40,801 Priced via independent broker-dealer quotations     Priced via models or other methods 4,595   4,595 Mortgage loans of consolidated VIEs 2,173   2,173 Total mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs 47,569   47,569 Total fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs $ 201,849 $ 6,594 $ 125,390 $ 69,865 Percentage of total 100.0 % 3.3 % 62.1 % 34.6 % The Company measures the fair value of its securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the assets, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk. The estimate of fair value is the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that security. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange while not under duress. The valuation of securities involves judgment, is subject to considerable variability and is revised as additional information becomes available. As such, changes in, or deviations from, the assumptions used in such valuations can significantly affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in security values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Companys ability to sell securities, or the price ultimately realized upon the sale of securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities. Accordingly, estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. For fixed maturity securities, the Company obtains the fair values, when available, based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are liquid securities and the valuation does not require significant management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market standard valuation techniques, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company obtains the fair value for most marketable bonds without an active market from several commercial pricing services. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, broker-dealer quotes, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, 116 Table of Contents offers, and other reference data. For certain fixed maturity securities without an active market, an internally-developed discounted cash flow or other approach is utilized to calculate the fair value. A discount rate is used, which adjusts a market comparable base rate for securities with similar characteristics for credit spread, market illiquidity or other adjustments. The fair value of privately placed fixed maturity securities is based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, the Company uses a matrix-based pricing model, which considers the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. The Company also considers additional factors, such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and its evaluation of the borrowers ability to compete in its relevant market. For equity securities, the Company obtains the fair value, when available, based on quoted market prices. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers. For mortgage loans, the company uses independent commercial pricing services. Discounted cash flow analysis is performed through which the loans contractual cash flows are modeled and an appropriate discount rate is determined to discount the cash flows to arrive at a present value. Financial factors, credit factors, collateral characteristics and current market conditions are all taken into consideration when performing the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company performs vendor due diligence exercises annually to review vendor processes, models and assumptions. Additionally, the Company reviews price movements on a quarterly basis to ensure reasonableness. Derivatives Valuation of Embedded Derivatives on Indexed Annuities Athene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If Athene determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract. Indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivative represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates and policyholder behavior. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athenes own credit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policys life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date. In general, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives will not directly correspond to the change in fair value of the hedging derivative assets. The derivatives are intended to hedge the index credits expected to be granted at the end of the current term. The options valued in the embedded derivatives represent the rights of the policyholder to receive index credits over the period indexed strategies are made available to the policyholder, which is typically longer than the current term of the options. From an economic basis, Athene believes it is suitable to hedge with options that align with the index terms of its indexed annuity products because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term. However, because the value of an embedded derivative in an indexed annuity contract is longer-dated, there is a duration mismatch which may lead to differences in the recognition of income and expense for accounting purposes. A significant assumption in determining policy liabilities for indexed annuities is the vector of rates used to discount indexed strategy cash flows. The change in risk-free rates is expected to drive most of the movement in the discount rates between periods. Changes to credit spreads for a given credit rating as well as any change to Athenes credit rating requiring a revised level of nonperformance risk would also be factors in the changes to the discount rate. If the discount rates used to discount the indexed strategy cash flows were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for indexed annuities recorded through the consolidated statements of operations. 117 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2023, Athene had embedded derivative liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of $9.1 billion. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on indexed annuity products from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2023 100 bps discount rate $ (499) 100 bps discount rate 552 However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the quantitative impact presented in the table above does not necessarily correspond to the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements. In determining the ranges, Athene has considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of discount rates that can reasonably be anticipated over the near-term. For additional information regarding sensitivities to interest rate risk and public equity risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  Sensitivities. Future Policy Benefits The future policy benefit liabilities associated with long duration contracts include term and whole-life products, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies. Liabilities for nonparticipating long duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected. For immediate annuities with life contingencies, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to the present value of future benefits and related expenses. Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses and policyholder behavior. Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data, adjusted to align with company experience, if needed. All cash flow assumptions, apart from expense assumptions, are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually, or more frequently, if actual experience suggests a revision is necessary. Immediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies, and assumed whole life contracts represent the significant majority of Athenes liabilities for future policy benefits. Significant assumptions for its immediate annuities with life contingencies include discount rates, assumptions for policyholder longevity and policyholder utilization for contracts with deferred lives, while significant assumptions for its whole life contracts include discount rates and assumptions for policyholder mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. In general, the reserve for future policy benefits will decrease when longevity decreases, resulting in remeasurement gains in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the discount rate in periods after a cohort has closed will not impact interest expense recognition within the consolidated statements of operations. However, changes in the discount rate will impact the recorded reserve on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with an offsetting unrealized gain or loss recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Athene uses a single A rate to calculate the present value of reserves related to its immediate annuities with life contingencies and assumed whole life products. For limited-payment contracts where premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established to the extent that gross premium exceeds the net premium reserve and included within future policy benefits. When the net premium ratio for the corresponding future policy benefit is updated for actual experience and changes to projected cash flow assumptions, both the future policy benefit reserve and deferred profit liability are retrospectively recalculated from the contract issuance date. Also included within the liability for future policy benefits is negative VOBA that was established for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the Mergers. Negative VOBA is related to Athenes immediate annuities with life contingencies and is subsequently measured on a basis generally consistent with the deferred profit liability. 118 Table of Contents The increase (decrease) to future policy benefit reserves from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2023 100 bps discount rate $ (3,859) 100 bps discount rate 4,683 Market Risk Benefits Market risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene issues and reinsures deferred annuity contracts, which include both traditional deferred and indexed annuities, that contain GLWB and GMDB riders. These riders meet the criteria for and are classified as market risk benefits. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset. At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder, which include explicit rider fees and other contract fees, and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder. Athene is also required to project the expected benefits that will be required for the riders in excess of the projected account balance. Determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance requires judgment for economic and actuarial assumptions, both of which are used in determining future policyholder account growth that will drive the amount of benefits required. Economic assumptions include interest rates and implied equity volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For riders on indexed annuities, this also includes assumptions about projected equity returns, which impact expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. When economic assumptions lead to an increase in expected future policy growth from higher interest and index crediting during the accumulation period, the higher projected account balance at the time of rider utilization decreases the inherent value of the rider as less payments for benefits are required in excess of the account balance. All else constant, the increase in the projected account balance will, therefore, result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability, or an increase if the market risk benefit is in an asset position, with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Policyholder behavior assumptions are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate decrements to policies with riders including lapses, full and partial withdrawals (surrender rate) and mortality and the utilization of the benefit riders. Base lapse rates consider the level of surrender charges and are dynamically adjusted based on the level of current interest rates relative to the guaranteed rates and the amount by which any rider guarantees are in a net positive position. Rider utilization assumptions consider the number and timing of policyholders electing the riders. Athene tracks and updates this assumption as experience emerges. Mortality assumptions are set at the product level and are generally based on standard industry tables with adjustments for historical experience and a provision for mortality improvement. While economic assumptions impact the projected account value and the benefits paid in excess of the account value, policyholder behavior assumptions, such as surrenders, impact the expected number of policies that will elect to utilize the rider. An expected increase in decrements and decrease in rider utilization, all else constant, will result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability or an increase in the market risk benefit asset with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. All inputs, including expected fees and assessments and economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For riders on indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. The discount rate used to present value the projected cash flows is a significant assumption, with the change in risk-free rates expected to drive most of the movement in discount rates between periods. A risk margin is deducted from the discount rate to reflect the uncertainty in the projected cash flows, such as variations in policyholder behavior, and a credit spread is added to reflect Athenes risk of nonperformance. If the discount rates used were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for the market risk benefits recorded through the consolidated statements of operations, except for the portion related to the change in nonperformance risk, which is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss). 119 Table of Contents The increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit balance from hypothetical changes in the discount rate is summarized as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2023 100 bps discount rate $ (719) 100 bps discount rate 897 Recent Accounting Pronouncements A list of recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to Apollo and its industries is included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies Fixed and determinable payments due in connection with the Companys material contractual obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2023: 2024 2025 - 2026 2027 - 2028 2029 and Thereafter Total (In millions) Asset Management Operating lease obligations 1 $ 73 $ 151 $ 150 $ 475 $ 849 Other long-term obligations 2 31 6   37 2022 AMH credit facility 3 1 2   3 Debt obligations 3 698 859 309 4,799 6,665 AOG Unit payment 4 175    175 978 1,018 459 5,274 7,729 Retirement Services Interest sensitive contract liabilities 21,413 40,305 56,669 86,283 204,670 Future policy benefits 2,695 5,693 5,392 39,507 53,287 Market risk benefits    5,608 5,608 Other policy claims and benefits 98    98 Dividends payable to policyholders 7 14 13 59 93 Debt 3 174 377 1,356 4,253 6,160 Securities to repurchase 5 894 1,702 1,828  4,424 25,281 48,091 65,258 135,710 274,340 Obligations $ 26,259 $ 49,109 $ 65,717 $ 140,984 $ 282,069 1 Operating lease obligations excludes $130 million of other operating expenses associated with operating leases. 2 Includes (i) payments on management service agreements related to certain assets and (ii) payments with respect to certain consulting agreements entered into by the Company. Note that a significant portion of these costs are reimbursable by funds. 3 The obligations for debt payments include contractual maturities of principal and estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the debt agreements. See note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these debt obligations. 4 On December 31, 2021, each holder of AOG Units (other than those held by the Company and Athene) sold a portion of their limited partnership interests to the Company in exchange for the AOG Unit Payment. See note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 5 The obligations for securities to repurchase payments include contractual maturities of principal and estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the agreements. Future interest payments on floating rate repurchase agreements were calculated using the December 31, 2023 interest rate. Note: Due to the fact that the timing of certain amounts to be paid cannot be determined or for other reasons discussed below, the following contractual commitments have not been presented in the table above. (i) As noted previously, the tax receivable agreement requires us to pay to our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners 85% of any tax savings received by AGM and its subsidiaries from our step-up in tax basis. The tax savings achieved may not ensure that we have sufficient cash available to pay this liability and we might be required to incur additional debt to satisfy this liability. (ii) Debt amounts related to the consolidated VIEs are not presented in the table above as the Company is not a guarantor of these non-recourse liabilities. (iii) In connection with the Stone Tower acquisition, Apollo agreed to pay the former owners of Stone Tower a specified percentage of any future performance fees earned from certain of the Stone Tower funds, CLOs and strategic investment accounts. In connection with the acquisition of Griffin Capitals U.S. asset management business on May 3, 2022, Apollo agreed to pay the former owners certain share-based consideration contingent on specified AUM and capital raising thresholds. These contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the obligations are satisfied. See note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the contingent consideration liabilities. (iv) Commitments from certain of our subsidiaries to contribute to the funds we manage and certain related parties. 120 Table of Contents Atlas Securitized Products Holdings LP In connection with the Company and CSs previously announced transaction, certain subsidiaries of Atlas acquired certain assets of the CS Securitized Products Group (the Transaction). Under the terms of the Transaction, Atlas has agreed to pay CS $3.3 billion, $0.4 billion of which is deferred until February 8, 2026, and $2.9 billion of which is deferred until February 8, 2028. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. Each of AARe and AAM has issued an assurance letter to CS for the full deferred purchase obligation amount of $3.3 billion. In exchange for the purchase price, Atlas received approximately $0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately $1 billion of tangible equity value. These warehouse assets are senior secured assets at industry standard loan-to-value ratios, structured to investment grade-equivalent criteria, and were approved by Atlas in connection with this Transaction. In addition, Atlas has received an investment management contract to manage certain unrelated assets on behalf of CS, providing for quarterly payments expected to total approximately $1.1 billion net to Atlas over 5 years. Finally, Atlas shall also benefit generally from the net spread earned on its assets in excess of its cost of financing. As a result, the fair value of the liability related to the Companys assurance letter is not material to the consolidated financial statements. Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information The 2033 Senior Notes and the 2053 Subordinated Notes issued by AGM are guaranteed on a junior, unsecured basis by AAM, together with certain Apollo intermediary holding companies (collectively, the Guarantors). The Guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on a subordinated, unsecured basis. See note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this debt obligation. AGM, as issuer, and the Guarantors are holding companies. The primary sources of cash flow are dependent upon distributions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their future obligations under the notes and the guarantees, respectively. The 2033 Senior Notes and 2053 Subordinated Notes are not guaranteed by any fee generating businesses, Apollo-managed funds, or Athene and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against AGM as issuer. The following tables present summarized financial information of AGM, as the issuer of the debt securities, and the Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Guarantors and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary. As used herein, obligor group means AGM, as the issuer of the debt securities, and the Guarantors on a combined basis. The summarized financial information is provided in accordance with the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 under SEC Regulation S-X for the obligor group and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the obligor group in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as such principles are in effect in the United States.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of incurring losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Included in market risk are potential losses in value due to credit and counterparty risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. In our asset management business, our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as investment manager and general partner for the funds we manage and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments and resulting impact on performance fees and management fee revenues. Our direct investments in the funds we manage also expose us to market risk whereby movements in the fair values of the underlying investments will increase or decrease both net gains (losses) from investment activities and income (loss) from equity method investments. Our retirement services business is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolio, its counterparty exposures and its hedging and reinsurance activities. Athenes primary market risk exposures are to credit risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. Risk Management Framework The Companys risk management frameworks are designed to identify, assess and prioritize risks to ensure that senior management understands and can manage our risk profile. Governance over risk exists at both the board level and management level for both the asset management and retirement services businesses. The audit committee of the board of directors of AGM is tasked with reviewing major financial risk exposures of the Company and managements risk assessment and risk management policies. Asset Management In our asset management business, risks are analyzed across strategies from both a bottom up and top down perspective. We gather and analyze data, monitor investments and markets in detail, and constantly strive to better quantify, qualify and circumscribe relevant risks. Each risk management process is subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy and our asset management enterprise risk management framework. This framework governs all business units within the asset management business and (1) conveys our risk culture; (2) outlines our risk management methodology; (3) identifies key roles and responsibilities, and (4) summarizes our core risk areas including, but not limited to, market, credit and operational risks. Investment and risk management processes are tailored to each respective investment portfolio subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy:  With respect to the yield and hybrid funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive trading opportunities, applying a number of traditional and customized risk management metrics to analyze risk related to specific assets or portfolios.  The investment process of the equity funds we manage involves a detailed analysis of potential acquisitions, with investment management teams assigned to monitor the strategic development, financing and capital deployment decisions of each portfolio investment. The AAM Global Risk Committee (AGRC) is tasked with assisting AAM in monitoring and managing enterprise risk for the asset management business. The AGRC is chaired by a Co-President of AAM and includes other members of senior 122 Table of Contents management of Apollos asset management business. Managing risk is the responsibility of all AAM employees. Businesses and investment professionals are responsible for all the risk taken on and managed in their business areas and risk management groups provide an objective challenge to, and oversight of, the business risk management. Risk management groups of the Companys asset management business provide summary analysis of fund level market and credit risk to the portfolio managers of the funds managed by Apollo and the heads of the various business units. On a periodic basis, risk owners also provide analyses of select market and credit risk components to various members of senior management. In addition, the business and risk leaders of the Companys asset management business review specific investments from the perspective of risk mitigation and discuss such analysis with the AGRC or other members of senior management when needed. Retirement Services The processes supporting risk management for our retirement services business are designed to ensure that Athenes risk profile is consistent with its stated risk appetite and that it maintains sufficient capital and liquidity to support its corporate plan, while meeting the requirements imposed by its policyholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The risk management function at Athene strives to maximize the value of its existing business platform to the Companys stockholders, preserve the ability to realize business and market opportunities under stressed market conditions and withstand the impact of severely adverse events. AHLs risk management framework includes a governance committee structure that supports accountability in current risk-based decision making and effective risk management. Governance committees are established at three levels: the AHL board of directors, AHL management and subsidiary management. AHL utilizes a host of assessment tools to monitor and assess its risk profile, results of which are shared with senior management periodically at management level committees, such as the risk committee (RC) and the investment and asset liability committee (IALC), and with the AHL board of directors quarterly. Business management retains the primary responsibility for day-to-day management of risk. The risk management team at Athene consists of eight teams: Business and Operational Risk, ALM, Regulatory and Risk Analytics, Derivative Governance & Risk Policy, Derivatives and Structured Solutions, Asset Risk Management, Strategic & Emerging Risk and Risk Operations & Change Management. The risk management team is led by AHLs Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the chair of the AHL Risk Committee. AHLs risk management team is comprised of more than 50 dedicated, full-time employees. Asset and Liability Management Asset and liability risk management is a joint effort that spans business management and the entire risk management team. Processes established to analyze and manage the risks of Athenes assets and liabilities include but are not limited to:  analyzing AHLs liabilities to ascertain their sensitivity to behavioral variations and changes in market conditions and actuarial assumptions;  analyzing interest rate risk, cash flow mismatch, and liquidity risk;  performing scenario and stress analyses to examine their impacts on capital and earnings;  performing cash flow testing and capital modeling;  modeling the values of the derivatives embedded in its policy liabilities so that they can be effectively hedged;  hedging unwanted risks, including from embedded derivatives, interest rate exposures and currency risks;  reviewing its corporate plan and strategic objectives, and identifying prospective risks to those objectives under normal and stressed economic, behavioral and actuarial conditions; and  providing appropriate risk reports that show consolidated risk exposures from assets and liabilities as well as the economic consequences of stress events and scenarios. 123 Table of Contents Market Risk and Management of Market Risk Exposures Asset Management Impact on Management Fees Our management fees are based on one of the following:  capital commitments to an Apollo fund;  capital invested in an Apollo fund;  the gross, net or adjusted asset value of an Apollo fund, as defined; or  as otherwise defined in the respective agreements. Management fees could be impacted by changes in market risk factors, including (i) changes in invested capital or in market values to below cost, due to which management could consider an investment permanently impaired, in the case of certain funds or (ii) changes in gross or net asset value, for the yield funds. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV is dependent on the number and types of funds in existence and the current stage of each funds life cycle. Impact on Advisory and Transaction Fees We earn transaction fees relating to certain yield, hybrid and equity transactions and may obtain reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Subsequently, on a quarterly or annual basis, ongoing advisory fees, and additional transaction fees in connection with additional purchases, dispositions, or follow-on transactions, may be earned. Management fee offsets and any broken deal costs, if applicable, are reflected as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees. Advisory and transaction fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors to the extent that they limit our opportunities to engage in yield, hybrid, and equity transactions or impair our ability to consummate such transactions. The impact of changes in market risk factors on advisory and transaction fees is not readily predicted or estimated. Impact on Performance Fees We earn performance fees from the funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Our performance fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors. However, several major factors will influence the degree of impact:  the performance criteria for each individual fund in relation to how that funds results of operations are impacted by changes in market risk factors;  whether such performance criteria are annual or over the life of the fund;  to the extent applicable, the previous performance of each fund in relation to its performance criteria; and  whether each funds performance fee distributions are subject to contingent repayment. As a result, the impact of changes in market risk factors on performance fees will vary widely from fund to fund. The impact is heavily dependent on the prior and future performance of each fund, and therefore is not readily predicted or estimated. Market Risk We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of investments will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in each of the investments of the funds we manage, including equity investments, loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, hedging instruments, credit default swaps and other derivatives. Just a few of the market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest, currency exchange rates and credit spreads, equity prices or changes in the implied volatility of interest rates. Volatility in debt and equity markets can impact our pace of capital deployment, the timing of receipt of transaction fee revenues and the timing of realizations. These market conditions could have an impact on the value of fund investments and rates of return. Accordingly, depending on the instruments or activities impacted, market risks can have wide ranging, complex adverse effects on our results from operations and our overall financial condition. We monitor market risk using certain strategies and methodologies which management evaluates periodically for appropriateness. We intend to continue to monitor this risk going forward and continue to monitor our exposure to all market factors. 124 Table of Contents The Company is subject to a concentration risk related to the investors in the funds it manages. There are more than 1,000 investors in Apollos active yield, hybrid, and equity funds, and no individual investor accounts for more than 10% of the total committed capital to Apollos active funds. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to instruments whose values vary with the change in interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, borrowings, investments in interest bearing securities and derivative instruments. We may seek to mitigate risks associated with the exposures by having the funds take offsetting positions in derivative contracts. Hedging instruments allow us to seek to mitigate risks by reducing the effect of movements in the level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve, as well as, changes in interest rate volatility. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks may include related derivatives such as options, futures and swaps. Credit Risk Credit risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to investments or other activity whose value varies with the change in credit spreads, the change in the probability of default by the borrow or the actual default and failure to repay a loan or contractual obligation. Certain of the funds we manage are subject to certain inherent risks through their investments. Certain entities we manage invest substantially all of their excess cash in open-end money market funds and money market demand accounts, which are included in cash and cash equivalents. The money market funds invest primarily in government securities and other short-term, highly liquid instruments with a low risk of loss. We continually monitor the funds performance in order to manage any risk associated with these investments. Certain funds we manage hold derivative instruments that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. We seek to minimize risk exposure by limiting the counterparties with which the funds enter into contracts to banks and investment banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. Counterparty risk may be further mitigated by the exchange of collateral with a counterparty as a form of credit support for derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2023, we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and therefore do not expect to incur any loss due to counterparty default. Certain investments of the funds we manage include lower-rated and comparable quality unrated distressed investments and other instruments. Investments in such debt instruments are accompanied by a greater degree of risk of loss due to default by the issuer because such debt instruments are generally unsecured and subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. These issuers generally have high levels of indebtedness and can be more sensitive to adverse market conditions, such as a recession or increasing interest rates, as compared to higher rated issuers. We seek to minimize risk exposure by subjecting each prospective investment to rigorous credit analysis and by making investment decisions based upon objectives that include capital preservation and appreciation, and industry and issuer diversification. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures the funds we manage have to changes in the values of current fund holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies and investments in non-U.S. companies. The types of investments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated transactions, and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures and forwards. These instruments may be used to help insulate the funds we manage against losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates and/or interest rates. In our capacity as investment manager of the funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive opportunities for managing risk. For example, certain of the funds we manage may put in place foreign exchange hedges or borrowings with respect to certain foreign currency denominated investments to provide a hedge against foreign exchange exposure. 125 Table of Contents Non-U.S. Operations We have offices and conduct business throughout the world and are continuing to expand into foreign markets. Our fund investments and our revenues are primarily derived from our U.S. operations. With respect to our non-U.S. operations, we are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership. The funds we manage also invest in the securities of companies which are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As we continue to expand globally, we will continue to focus on monitoring and managing these risk factors as they relate to specific non-U.S. investments. Retirement Services Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk To operate Athenes business model, which is based on generating spread related earnings, it must bear credit risk. However, as Athene assumes credit risk through its investment, reinsurance and hedging activities, it endeavors to ensure that risk exposures remain diversified, that it is adequately compensated for the risks it assumes and that the level of risk is consistent with its risk appetite and objectives. Credit risk is a key risk taken in the asset portfolio, as the credit spread on Athenes investments is what drives its spread related earnings. Athene manages credit risk by avoiding idiosyncratic risk concentrations, understanding and managing its systematic exposure to economic and market conditions through stress testing, monitoring investment activity daily and distinguishing between price and default risk from credit exposures. Concentration and portfolio limits are designed to ensure that exposure to default and impairment risk is sufficiently modest to not represent a solvency risk, even in severe economic conditions. The approach to taking credit risk in our retirement services business is formulated based on:  a fundamental view on existing and potential opportunities at the security level;  an assessment of the current risk/reward proposition for each market segment;  identification of downside risks and assigning a probability for those risks; and  establishing a plan for best execution of the investment action. A dedicated set of AHL risk managers monitor the asset risks to ensure that such risks are consistent with Athenes risk appetite, standards for committing capital and overall strategic objectives. Athenes risk management team is also a key contributor to the credit impairment evaluation process. In addition to credit-risk exposures from its investment portfolio, Athene is also exposed to credit risk from its counterparty exposures from its derivative hedging and reinsurance activities. Derivative counterparty risk is managed by trading on a collateralized basis with counterparties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association documents with a credit support annex having zero-dollar collateral thresholds. Athene utilizes reinsurance to mitigate risks that are inconsistent with its strategy or objectives. For example, Athene has reinsured much of the mortality risk it would otherwise have accumulated through its various acquisitions and block reinsurance transactions, allowing it to focus on its core annuity business. These reinsurance agreements expose Athene to the credit risk of its counterparties. Athene manages this risk to avoid counterparty risk concentrations through various mechanisms: utilization of reinsurance structures such as funds withheld or modco to retain ownership of the assets and limit counterparty risk to the cost of replacing the counterparty; diversification across counterparties; and when possible, novating policies to eliminate counterparty risk altogether. Interest Rate Risk Significant interest rate risk may arise from mismatches in the timing of cash flows from Athenes assets and liabilities. Management of interest rate risk at the company-wide level, and at the various operating company levels, is one of the main risk management activities in which AHL senior management engages. Depending upon the materiality of the risk and Athenes assessment of how it would perform across a spectrum of interest rate environments, Athene may seek to mitigate interest rate risk using on-balance-sheet strategies (portfolio management) or off-balance-sheet strategies (derivative hedges such as interest rate swaps and futures). Athene monitors ALM metrics (such as key-rate durations and convexity) and employs quarterly cash flow testing requirements across all of its insurance companies to 126 Table of Contents assure the asset and liability portfolios are managed to maintain net interest rate exposures at levels that are consistent with its risk appetite. Athene has established a set of exposure and stress limits to communicate its risk tolerance and to ensure adherence to those risk tolerance levels. Risk management personnel and the RC and/or IALC (together, AHL management committees) are notified in the event that risk tolerance levels are exceeded. Depending on the specific risk threshold that is exceeded, the appropriate AHL management committee then makes a decision as to what actions, if any, should be undertaken. Active portfolio management is performed by our asset management business, with direction from the AHL management committees. ALM risk is also managed by the AHL management committees. The performance of Athenes investment portfolio is reviewed periodically by the AHL management committees and board of directors. The AHL management committees strive to improve returns to stockholders and protect policyholders, while dynamically managing the risk within Athenes expectations. Equity Risk Athenes FIAs require it to make payments to policyholders that are dependent on the performance of equity market indices. Athene seeks to minimize the equity risk from its liabilities by economically defeasing this equity exposure with granular, policy-level-based hedging. In addition, Athenes investment portfolio can be invested in strategies involving public and private equity positions, though in general, it has limited appetite for passive, public equity investments. The equity index hedging framework implemented is one of static and dynamic replication. Unique policy-level liability options are matched with static OTC options and residual risk arising from (1) policy holder behavior and other trading constraints (for example minimum trade size) and (2) the decision by the organization to enhance the value of the product offerings by dynamically managing a small portion of the exposure on custom indices, are managed dynamically by decomposing the risk of the portfolio (asset and liability positions) into market risk measures which are managed to pre-established risk limits. The portfolio risks are measured overnight and rebalanced daily to ensure that the risk profile remains within risk appetite. Valuation is done at the position level, and risks are aggregated and shown at the level of each underlying index. Risk measures that have term structure sensitivity, such as index volatility risk and interest rate risk, are monitored and risk managed along the term structure. Athene is also exposed to equity risk in its alternative investment portfolio. The form of those investments is typically a limited partnership interest in a fund. Athene currently targets fund investments that have characteristics resembling fixed income investments versus those resembling pure equity investments, but as holders of partnership positions, Athenes investments are generally held as equity positions. Alternative investments are comprised of several categories, including at the most liquid end of the spectrum liquid strategies, (which is mostly exposure to publicly traded equities), followed by yield, equity and hybrid strategies. Athenes alternatives portfolio also includes strategic equity investments in origination platforms, insurance platforms and others. Athenes investment mandate in its alternative investment portfolio is inherently opportunistic. Each investment is examined and analyzed on its own merits to gain a full understanding of the risks present, and with a view toward determining likely return scenarios, including the ability to withstand stress in a downturn. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk. The alternative investment portfolio is monitored to ensure diversification across asset classes and strategy, and the portfolio's performance under stress scenarios is evaluated routinely as part of management and board reviews. Since alternative investments are marked-to-market on the consolidated statements of financial condition, risk analyses focus on potential changes in market value across a variety of market stresses. Currency Risk Athene manages its currency risk to maintain minimal exposure to currency fluctuations. It attempts to hedge completely the currency risk arising on its balance sheet. In general, Athene matches currency exposure of assets and liabilities. When the currency denominations of the assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate currency mismatch risk. Inflation Risk Athene manages its inflation risk to maintain minimal exposure to changes in purchasing power. In general, it attempts to match inflation exposure of assets and liabilities. When the inflation exposure profiles of assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate inflation mismatch risk. Athene attempts to hedge the majority of inflation risk arising from the pension group annuity business that it reinsures. 127 Table of Contents Scenario Analysis Athene evaluates exposure to credit risk by analyzing its portfolios performance during simulated periods of economic stress. Athene manages business, capital and liquidity needs to withstand stress scenarios and target capital it believes will maintain its current ratings in a moderate recession scenario and maintain investment grade ratings under a deep recession scenario, a substantially severe financial crisis akin to the Lehman scenario in 2008. In the recession scenario, Athene calibrates recessionary shocks to several key risk factors (including but not limited to default rates, recoveries, credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields) using data from the 1991, 2001 and 2008 recessions, and estimates impacts to the various sectors in its portfolio. In the deep recession scenario, Athene uses default probabilities from the 2008-2009 period, along with recovery and ratings migration rates, to estimate impairment impacts, and uses credit spread and interest rate movements from the 20082009 period to estimate mark to market changes. Management reviews the impacts of its stress test analyses on a quarterly basis. Sensitivities Asset Management Interest Rate Risk We are primarily subject to interest rate risk through the investments of the funds we manage. For funds that pay management fees based on NAV or other bases that are sensitive to market value fluctuations, we anticipate our management fees would change consistent with the increase or decrease experienced by the underlying funds portfolios. In the event that interest rates were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $21 million and $18 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Credit Risk Similar to interest rate risk, we are also subject to credit risk through the investments of the funds we manage. In the event that credit spreads were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $22 million and $22 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk We estimate for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in the following declines in management fees and investment income (loss): Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 Management fees $ 24 $ 21 Investment income (loss) 1 1 9 1 We estimate a 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in increases in performance fees, included within investment income (loss), during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, such increases are not included within the decline in investment income (loss). Net Gains from Investment Activities and Investment Income Our assets and unrealized gains, and our related equity and net income are sensitive to changes in the valuations of the underlying investments of the funds we manage and could vary materially as a result of changes

ssumptions and estimates. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates and PoliciesAsset ManagementInvestments, at Fair Value for details related to the valuation methods that are used and the key assumptions and estimates employed by such methods. We also quantify the Level 3 investments that are included on our consolidated statements of financial condition by valuation methodology in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. We employ a variety of valuation methods. Furthermore, the investments that we manage but are not on our consolidated statements of financial condition, and therefore impact performance fees, also employ a variety of valuation methods of which no single methodology is used more than any other. 128 Table of Contents Management Fees Management fees are primarily based on the net asset value of the relevant fund, gross assets, adjusted equity, capital commitments, invested capital, or as defined in the respective funds management agreements. Changes in the fair values of the investments that earn management fees based on net asset value, gross assets or adjusted equity will have a direct impact on the amount of management fees that are earned. Management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 would decrease by approximately $58 million and $51 million, respectively, if the fair values of the investments held by such funds were 10% lower during the same respective periods. Management fees for equity and certain hybrid funds we manage are generally charged on either (a) a fixed percentage of committed capital over a stated investment period or (b) a fixed percentage of invested capital of unrealized portfolio investments. Changes in values of investments could indirectly affect future management fees from such funds by, among other things, reducing the funds access to capital or liquidity and their ability to currently pay the management fees or if such change resulted in a write-down of investments below their associated invested capital. Investment Income (Loss) and Net Gains from Investment Activities Performance Allocations Performance allocations from the funds we manage generally are earned based on achieving specified performance criteria and are impacted directly by changes in the fair value of the funds investments. We anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair values of investments held by all of the funds we manage would decrease performance allocations by approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Principal Investment Income  For select funds managed by Apollo, our share of income from equity method investments as a general partner in such funds is derived from unrealized gains or losses on investments in funds included in the consolidated financial statements. For funds in which we have an interest, but are not consolidated, our share of investment income is limited to our direct investments in the funds. We anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair value of investments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 would result in an approximate $247 million and $235 million decrease in principal investment income and net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated financial statements, respectively. Retirement Services Interest Rate Risk Athene assesses interest rate exposure for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was an immediate parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2023, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $2.5 billion, net of offsets. If there was a similar parallel increase in interest rates from levels as of December 31, 2022, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $2.1 billion, net of offsets. The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2023, when compared to December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by the significant growth experienced in 2023. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include derivative instruments, embedded derivatives, mortgage loans, certain fixed maturity securities and market risk benefits. The sensitivity analysis excludes those financial instruments carried at fair value for which changes in fair value are recognized in equity, such as AFS fixed maturity securities. Assuming a 25 basis point increase in interest rates that persists for a 12-month period, the estimated impact to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities would be an increase of approximately $45  $55 million, and a 25 basis point decrease would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions. With the implementation of LDTI in accounting for long-duration insurance and investment contracts, changes in the fair value of market risk benefits due to current period movement in the interest rate curve used to discount the reserve are reflected in net income (loss) but excluded from spread related earnings. However, changes in interest rates that impact the cost of the projected 129 Table of Contents GLWB and GMDB rider benefits, included within Athenes market risk benefit reserve, are amortized within cost of funds in spread related earnings over the life of the business. Assuming a parallel increase in interest rates of 25 basis points, the estimated impact to spread related earnings over a 12-month period related to market risk benefits would be an increase of approximately $20  $40 million, and a parallel decrease in interest rates of 25 basis points would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions. Athene is unable to make forward-looking estimates regarding the impact on net income (loss) of changes in interest rates that persist for a longer period of time, or changes in the shape of the yield curve over time, as a result of an inability to determine how such changes will affect certain of the items that Athene characterizes as adjustments to income (loss) before income taxes in its reconciliation between net income (loss) available

ckholder and spread related earnings. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSummary of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures for the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AGM common stockholders to adjusted net income, of which spread related earnings is a component. The impact of changing rates on these adjustments is likely to be significant. See above for a discussion regarding the estimated impact on income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit of an immediate, parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2023, which discussion encompasses the impact of such an increase on certain of the adjustment items. The models used to estimate the impact of changes in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions, require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any discretionary management action to counteract such a change. Consequently, potential changes in Athenes valuations indicated by these simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under any given interest rate scenarios and these differences may be material. Because Athene actively manages its assets and liabilities, the net exposure to interest rates can vary over time. However, any such decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition of credit losses, would generally be realized only if Athene were required to sell such securities at losses to meet liquidity needs. Public Equity Risk Athene assesses public equity market risk for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was a decline in public equity market prices of 10% as of December 31, 2023, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $538 million. As of December 31, 2022, Athene estimates that a decline in public equity market prices of 10% would cause a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $312 million. The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2023, when compared to December 31, 2022, is primarily driven by equity market performance during the year, which has resulted in more equity exposure to public equity market price declines. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include public equity investments, derivative instruments, market risk benefits and the FIA embedded derivative. 130 Table

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Apollo Global Management, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12, Financial Services  Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, with retrospective application to January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2018-12 is also communicated as a critical audit matter below. Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 132 Table of Contents that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Performance Allocations Refer to Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Critical Audit Matter Description The Company, through its asset management business, recognizes performance allocations from the funds it manages within investment income to the extent these funds meet or achieve certain performance criteria. The Company recognizes performance allocations each reporting period based on the terms outlined in the respective fund governing agreements. Further, the fair value of the underlying investments held by the funds is a significant input to the evaluation and recognition of performance allocations. Certain funds may hold significant illiquid investments whose fair values are based on unobservable inputs. These investments have limited observable market activity and changes in the fair value of these investments directly impact the amount of performance allocations the Company is entitled to recognize as investment income for the period. Auditing the performance allocation calculations involves critical evaluation of the appropriate legal interpretation and application of the terms of the respective fund governing agreements, inclusive of any contingent repayment provisions. Auditing the fair value of illiquid investments, which are based on unobservable inputs, involves especially subjective auditor judgment and the subject matter expertise of our fair value specialists to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation methods, assumptions, and unobservable inputs used by the Company to determine fair value. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the funds performance allocation calculations and the testing of fair value of illiquid investments held by the funds included the following, among others:  We involved senior, more experienced audit team members in the performance of our audit procedures.  We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over managements performance allocation calculations and the determination of the fair value of illiquid investments.  We evaluated, on a sample basis, whether the Companys performance allocation calculations were performed in accordance with the terms of the funds governing agreements.  We utilized our fair value specialists to assist in our evaluation of the valuation methods, assumptions and unobservable inputs used by the Company to determine the fair value of certain illiquid investments held by the funds.  We evaluated the Companys historical ability to accurately estimate the fair value of illiquid investments by comparing previous estimates of fair value to market transactions with third parties. 133 Table of Contents Valuation of Certain Structured Level 3 Asset-Backed Securities - Refer to Note 5 , Investments, Note 8 , Fair Value, and Note 19, Related Parties Critical Audit Matter Description Investments in certain structured Level 3 asset-backed securities held by the Company, through its retirement services business, are reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. These investments without readily determinable market values, are valued using significant unobservable inputs that involve considerable judgment by management. The Company uses internal modeling techniques based on projected cash flows and certain other unobservable inputs to value its structured Level 3 asset-backed securities. The significant unobservable inputs may include discount rates, issue specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, and liquidity assumptions. Given that the Company utilizes valuation models and significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value for certain of its structured Level 3 asset-backed securities, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the valuation models and significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of investments in certain structured Level 3 asset-backed securities included the following, among others:  We involved senior, more experienced audit team members in the performance of our audit procedures.  We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over managements determination of the fair value of these securities.  With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we:  Evaluated the valuation models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate fair value for a sample of these securities.  Developed independent fair value estimates and compared our estimates to the Companys estimates for a sample of these securities.  On a sample basis, we evaluated the Companys historical ability to accurately estimate the fair value of these securities by comparing previous estimates of fair value to market transactions with third parties adjusted for changes in market conditions. Adoption of Long Duration Targeted Improvements (LDTI) - Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 3, Adoption of Accounting Pronouncement Critical Audit Matter Description On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2018-12 retrospectively with a transition date of January 1, 2022 (see Change in Accounting Principle explanatory paragraph above). The adoption of LDTI significantly modifies the Companys accounting and disclosure of contract features meeting the definition of market risk benefits to be measured at fair value. For the Company, this definition includes the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit and guaranteed minimum death benefit riders attached to some of the annuity products. Significant judgment was applied by the Company in determining the modifications to complex valuation models and the assumptions utilized in those models. Specifically, the future policyholder behavior assumptions related to lapses and the use of benefit riders, as well as the assumptions for the future equity option costs or option budget and risk margin involve significant unobservable inputs and may materially impact the estimated valuation of the market risk benefits. Given the significant judgment involved with determining the methodology and these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, auditing these estimates required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value and actuarial specialists. 134 Table of Contents How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the selection of the methodology and economic and policyholder behavior assumptions determined by the Company included the following, among others:  We involved senior, more experienced audit team members, including fair value and actuarial specialists, to plan and perform audit procedures.  We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls, including those related to the application of new accounting policies, new subjective judgments, changes made to measurement models, and disclosure of the impact of adoption discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements.  We evaluated the appropriateness of the Companys accounting policies, methodologies, and elections involved in the adoption of the LDTI.  We involved our actuarial specialists, to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the methodology and changes made to the measurement models. Certain Assumptions Used in the Valuation of Future Policy Benefits, Market Risk Benefits, and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities - Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , Note 8, Fair Value , and Note 12, Long-duration Contracts Critical Audit Matter Description The Company determines estimated valuations of Future Policy Benefits, Market Risk Benefits, and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities, which include embedded derivatives. The Companys valuations are based on actuarial methodologies and include significant unobservable inputs associated with underlying economic and future policyholder behavior assumptions. Significant judgment is applied by the Company in determining these assumptions. Specifically, the future policyholder behavior assumptions related to lapses and the use of benefit riders, as well as the assumptions for the future equity option costs or option budget and risk margin involve significant unobservable inputs and may materially impact the estimated valuation of Future Policy Benefits, Market Risk Benefits, and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities, which include embedded derivatives. Given the significant judgement involved with determining these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, auditing these estimates requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value and actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions determined by the Company included the following, among others:  We involved senior, more experienced audit team members, including fair value and actuarial specialists, to plan and perform audit procedures.  We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over managements development of these assumptions, including those controls over the underlying data.  With the assistance of our fair value and actuarial specialists, we:  Evaluated the methods, models, and judgements applied by the Company in determining these assumptions, including evaluating the results of experience studies or other data used as a basis for setting those assumptions.

Merger with Athene On January 1, 2022, Apollo and Athene completed the previously announced merger transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the Mergers). As a result of the Mergers, AAM and AHL became consolidated subsidiaries of AGM. Athenes results are included in the consolidated financial statements commencing from the Merger Date. References herein to Apollo and the Company refer to AGM and its subsidiaries, including Athene, unless the context requires otherwise such as in sections where it refers to the asset management business only. See note 4 for additional information.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results of the Company and its subsidiaries are presented on a consolidated basis. Any ownership interest other than the Companys interest in its subsidiaries is reflected as a non-controlling interest. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) so that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that any estimates made are reasonable and prudent. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current periods presentation. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Mergers, Apollo was deemed to be the accounting acquirer and Athene the accounting acquiree, which, for financial reporting purposes, results in Apollos historical financial information prior to the Mergers becoming that of the Company. Athenes results before the Mergers have not been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Athene from the date of acquisition. For information on Athene prior to the Mergers, please refer to the annual financial statements included in AHLs annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Following the Mergers, the Companys principal subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, together with their subsidiaries, operate an asset management business and a retirement services business, respectively, which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, the Companys financial statement presentation is organized into two tiers: asset management and retirement services. The 146 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company believes that separate presentation provides a more informative view of the Companys consolidated financial condition and results of operations than an aggregated presentation. The following summary of significant accounting policies first includes those most significant to the overall Company and then specific accounting policies for each of the asset management and retirement services businesses, respectively. Significant Accounting Policies  Overall Consolidation The Company consolidates entities where it has a controlling financial interest unless there is a specific scope exception that prevents consolidation. The types of entities with which the Company is involved generally include, but are not limited to:  subsidiaries, which includes AAM and its subsidiaries, including management companies and general partners of funds that the Company manages, and AHL and its subsidiaries  funds, including entities that have attributes of an investment company  SPACs  CLOs Each of these entities is assessed for consolidation based on its specific facts and circumstances. In determining whether to consolidate an entity, the Company first evaluates whether the entity is a VIE or a VOE and applies the appropriate consolidation model as discussed below. If an entity is not consolidated, then the Companys investment is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting or as a financial instrument as discussed in the related policy discussions below. Investment Companies Judgment is required to evaluate whether an entity has the necessary characteristics to be accounted for as an investment company under U.S. GAAP. The funds managed by the Company that meet the investment company criteria reflect their investments at fair value. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities All entities are first considered under the VIE model. VIEs are entities that 1) do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or 2) have equity investors at risk that do not have the ability to make significant decisions related to the entitys operations, absorb expected losses, or receive expected residual returns. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary when it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, which is defined as possessing both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance (primary beneficiary power) and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (significant variable interest). The Company performs the VIE and primary beneficiary assessment at inception of its involvement with a VIE and on an ongoing basis if facts and circumstances change. To assess whether the Company has the primary beneficiary power under the VIE consolidation model, it considers the design of the entity as well as ongoing rights and responsibilities. In general, the parties that can make the most significant decisions regarding asset management have control over servicing, liquidation rights or the unilateral right to remove the decision-makers. To assess whether the Company has a significant variable interest, the Company considers all its economic interests that are considered variable interests in the entity, including interests held through related parties. This assessment requires judgment in considering whether those interests are significant. Assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs, other than SPACs, are primarily shown in separate sections within the consolidated statements of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses are primarily presented within net gains from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion attributable to non-controlling interests is reported within net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. For additional disclosures regarding VIEs, see notes 7 and 19. 147 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Voting Interest Entities Entities that are not determined to be VIEs are generally considered VOEs. Under the voting interest model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. The Company does not consolidate those VOEs in which substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the unrelated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner. Non-controlling Interests For entities that are consolidated, but not wholly owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than the Company. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests also include ownership interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs. Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of equity on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the holders of non-controlling interests on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests regardless of their basis. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related footnotes. The Companys most significant estimates include goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, performance allocations, incentive fees, non-cash compensation, fair value of investments (including derivatives) and debt, impairment of investments and allowances for expected credit losses, and future policy benefit reserves. While such impact may change considerably over time, the estimates and assumptions affecting the Companys consolidated financial statements are based on the best available information as of December 31, 2023. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments, including money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities, with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Interest income from cash and cash equivalents is recorded in other income for asset management and net investment income for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying values of the money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities represent their fair values due to their short-term nature. Substantially all of the Companys cash on deposit is in interest bearing accounts with major financial institutions and exceed insured limits. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent balances that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents held in funds in trust as part of certain coinsurance agreements to secure statutory reserves and liabilities of the coinsured parties. Restricted cash also includes cash deposited at a bank that is pledged as collateral in connection with leased premises. Restricted cash and cash equivalents also consists of money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, that were purchased with funds raised through the respective IPOs of APSG II and Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp. (Acropolis), both SPACs sponsored by Apollo. The restricted cash and cash equivalents may only be used for purposes of completing an initial business combination or redemption of public shares as set forth in the respective trust agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our consolidated SPACs were liquidated in accordance with their governing documents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents were returned to the SPACs public shareholders. Foreign Currency The Company holds foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of the Companys international subsidiaries are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates specific to each asset and 148 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS liability, the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period are used for all others. The results of the Companys foreign operations are remeasured using an average exchange rate for the respective reporting period. Currency remeasurement adjustments and gains and losses on the settlement of foreign currency translations are included within other income (loss), net for asset management or investment related gains (losses) for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Currency translation adjustments are included within other comprehensive income (loss), before tax within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The change in unrealized foreign currency exchange of any non-U.S. dollar denominated AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income (OCI) unless they are designated as part of a fair value hedge. Investments Equity Method Investments For investments in entities over which the Company exercises significant influence but does not meet the requirements for consolidation and has not elected the fair value option, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its share of the underlying income or loss of such entities adjusted for distributions. The Companys share of the underlying net income or loss of such entities is recorded in Investment income (loss) for asset management and Net investment income for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are recorded in investments or investments in related parties in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Generally, the underlying entities that the Company manages and invests in are primarily investment companies, and the carrying value of the Companys equity method investments approximates fair value. Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Repurchase Agreements A reverse repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the Company purchases financial instruments from a seller and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a fixed and determinable price at a future date. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the Company sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substant ially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a fixed and determinable price at a future date. Although reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements generally involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be resold or repurchased before or at the maturity of the agreement. As a result, the collateral received under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized and the collateral pledged under repurchase agreements are not derecognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Within asset management, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements generally sit within consolidated VIEs and as such, those reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements are reflected as investments and other liabilities, respectively, within the consolidated VIE section of the statements of financial condition. Additionally, the income (loss) related to those reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements from consolidated VIEs are included in Net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of operations. Reverse repurchase agreements within asset management are generally accounted for by electing the fair value option. For retirement services, the receivable under the reverse repurchase agreement is recorded as investment for the principal amount loaned under the agreement and the payable under a repurchase agreement is recognized as payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Earnings from reverse repurchase agreements are included in net investment income for retirement services on the consolidated statements of operations. For reverse repurchase agreements, the Company generally requires collateral with a fair value at least equal to the carrying value of the loaned amount, monitors the market value of the collateral on a periodic basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the fair value of the collateral, as appropriate, in order to mitigate credit exposure. 149 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Instruments held by Consolidated VIEs The consolidated VIEs managed by the Company are primarily investment companies and CLOs. Their investments include debt and equity securities held at fair value and reverse repurchase agreements. Financial instruments are generally accounted for on a trade date basis. Under a measurement alternative permissible for consolidated collateralized financing entities, the Company measures both the financial assets and financial liabilities of consolidated CLOs in its consolidated financial statements in both cases using the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever are more observable. Where financial assets are more observable, the financial assets of the consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value and the financial liabilities are measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the financial assets and the carrying value of any non-financial assets that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs less (ii) the sum of the fair value of any beneficial interests retained by the Company (other than those that represent compensation for services) and the Companys carrying value of any beneficial interests that represent compensation for services. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial liabilities (other than the beneficial interest retained by the Company) using a reasonable and consistent methodology. Where financial liabilities are more observable, the financial liabilities of the consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value and the financial assets are measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the financial liabilities, and the carrying value of any non-financial liabilities that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs less (ii) the carrying value of any non-financial assets that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial assets using a reasonable and consistent methodology. Net income attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc. reflects the Companys own economic interests in the consolidated CLOs, including (i) changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests retained by the Company and (ii) beneficial interests that represent compensation for collateral management services. Certain consolidated VIEs have applied the fair value option for certain investments in private debt securities that otherwise would not have been carried at fair value with gains and losses in net income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. Fair Value Option Entities are permitted to elect the fair value option (FVO) to carry at fair value certain financial assets and financial liabilities, including investments otherwise accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The FVO election is irrevocable and is applied to financial instruments on an individual basis at initial recognition or at eligible remeasurement events. Please refer to note 5 for additional information and other instances of when the Company has elected the FVO. Fair Value Hierarchy U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. 150 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows: Level 1  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of the reporting date. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these financial instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and the sale of such position would likely deviate from the quoted price. Level 2  Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. These financial instruments exhibit higher levels of liquid market observability as compared to Level 3 financial instruments. Level 3  Pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instrument and includes situations where there is little observable market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category generally include investments where the fair value is based on observable inputs as well as unobservable inputs. When a security is valued based on broker quotes, the Company subjects those quotes to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular financial instrument would qualify for classification as Level 2 or Level 3. These criteria include, but are not limited to, the number and quality of the broker quotes, the standard deviations of the observed broker quotes, and the percentage deviation from external pricing services. Investments in securities that are traded on a securities exchange or comparable over-the-counter quotation systems are valued based on Apollos pricing procedures, which utilize third party pricing vendors, broker dealers and closing prices from exchanges. If no sales of such investments are reported on such date, and in the case of over-the-counter securities or other investments for which the last sale date is not available, valuations are based on independent market quotations obtained from market participants, recognized pricing services or other sources deemed relevant, and the prices are based on the average of the bid and ask prices, or at ascertainable prices at the close of business on such day. Market quotations are generally based on valuation pricing models or market transactions of similar securities adjusted for security-specific factors such as relative capital structure priority and interest and yield risks, among other factors. When market quotations are not available, a model-based approach is used to determine fair value. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, a financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument when the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting where the consideration transferred for the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration obligations that are elements of the consideration transferred are recognized as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is recorded in separate line items for both the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. See note 4 for disclosure regarding the goodwill recorded related to the Mergers. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of the Companys reportable segments. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and 2022 and did not identify any impairment. 151 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Assets Other assets are primarily comprised of deferred tax assets, leases and fixed assets. Fixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and computer hardware and are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives and in the case of leasehold improvements the lesser of the useful life or the term of the lease. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may be impaired. Compensation and Benefits Compensation consists of (i) salary, bonus, and benefits, which includes base salaries, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, severance and employee benefits, (ii) equity-based awards granted to employees and non-employees that are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and (iii) profit sharing expense, which primarily consists of a portion of performance revenues earned from certain funds that are allocated to employees and former employees. Compensation costs are recorded in compensation and benefits for asset management and policy and other operating expense for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. Employees and non-employees who provide services to the Company are granted equity-based awards as compensation that are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Equity-based awards that do not require future service ( i.e. , vested awards) are expensed immediately. Equity-based employee awards that require future service are expensed over the relevant period of service. Equity-based awards that require performance metrics to be met are expensed only when the performance metric is met or deemed probable. Profit sharing amounts are recognized as the related performance revenues are earned. Accordingly, profit sharing amounts can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance revenues that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are generally not paid until the related performance revenue is distributed to the general partner upon realization of the funds investments (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind). Earnings Per Share As the Company has issued participating securities, the two-class method of computing earnings per share is used for all periods presented for common stock and participating securities as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. Under the two-class method, during periods of net income, the net income is first reduced for distributions declared on all classes of securities to arrive at undistributed earnings. During periods of net losses, the net loss is reduced for distributions declared on participating securities only if the security has the right to participate in the earnings of the entity and an objectively determinable contractual obligation to share in net losses of the entity. Participating securities include vested and unvested RSUs that participate in distributions, as well as unvested restricted shares. Whether during a period of net income or net loss, under the two-class method the remaining earnings are allocated to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security shares in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. Earnings or losses allocated to each class of security are then divided by the applicable weighted average outstanding shares to arrive at basic earnings per share. For the diluted earnings, the denominator includes all outstanding shares of common stock and includes the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the issuance of these potential shares of common stock. Share Repurchase When shares are repurchased, the Company can choose to record treasury shares or account for the repurchase as a constructive retirement. The Company accounted for share repurchases as constructive retirement, whereby it reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital by the amount of the original issuance, with any excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Under this method, issued and outstanding shares are reduced by the shares repurchased, and no treasury stock is recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 152 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes AGM is a Delaware corporation and generally all of its income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes. Certain subsidiaries of the Company operate as partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes and are subject to NYC UBT. Certain non-U.S. entities are also subject to non-U.S. corporate income taxes. In conjunction with the Mergers, Apollo underwent a reorganization from an Up-C structure to a C-corporation with a single class of common stock. Prior to the Mergers, Athene, and certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries have historically not been subject to U.S. corporate income taxes on their earnings. Due to the Mergers, Athenes non-U.S. earnings will generally be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Companys tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such determination, consideration is given to, among other things, the following:  whether sufficient taxable income exists within the allowed carryback or carryforward periods;  whether future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will occur, including any tax planning strategies that could be used;  the nature or character ( e.g. , ordinary vs. capital) of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; and  whether future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards exists. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs consist of costs incurred in obtaining financing and are amortized over the term of the financing using the effective interest method. These costs are generally recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Segment Reporting  Improvements to Reporting Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to incrementally add disclosures for public entities reporting segments including significant segments expenses and other segment items. The guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company in its 2024 annual report and in interim periods in 2025; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Income TaxesImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09) In December 2023, the FASB made amendments to update disclosures on income taxes including rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and certain amendments on disaggregation by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as relevant. The guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in 2025; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 153 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherCrypto Assets Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (ASU 2023-08) In December 2023, the FASB issued amendments on the accounting for and disclosure of crypto assets. The guidance requires assets that meet certain conditions be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also requires disclosures about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period. The guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company on January 1, 2025, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations  Joint Venture Formations (ASU 2023-05) The amendments in this update address how a joint venture initially recognizes and measures contributions received at its formation date. The amendments require a joint venture to apply a new basis of accounting upon formation and to initially recognize its assets and liabilities at fair value. The guidance is effective prospectively for all joint ventures formed on or after January 1, 2025, while retrospective application may be elected for a joint venture formed before the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASU 2023-02) In March 2023, the FASB issued guidance to introduce the option of applying the proportional amortization method (PAM) to account for investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits or other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met. Previously, PAM only applied to low-income housing tax credit investments. The Company early adopted the guidance on October 1, 2023, and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Fair Value Measurement  Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03) In June 2022, the FASB issued clarifying guidance that a restriction which is a characteristic of the holding entity rather than a characteristic of the equity security itself should not be considered in its fair value measurement. As a result, the Company is required to measure the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions attributable to the holding entity on the basis of the market price of the same equity security without those contractual restrictions. Companies are not permitted to recognize a contractual sale restriction attributable to the holding entity as a separate unit of account. The guidance also requires disclosures for these equity securities. The Company early adopted the guidance on July 1, 2023. The Company applied the guidance on a prospective basis, and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Insurance  Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (ASU 2020-11, ASU 2019-09, ASU 2018-12) These updates amend four key areas pertaining to the accounting and disclosures for long-duration insurance and investment contracts and are commonly referred to as long-duration targeted improvements (LDTI).  The update requires cash flow assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits to be updated at least annually and no longer allows a provision for adverse deviation. The remeasurement of the liability associated with the update of assumptions is required to be recognized in net income. Loss recognition testing is eliminated for traditional and limited-payment contracts. The update also requires the discount rate used in measuring the liability to be an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yield, which is to be updated at each reporting date. The change in liability due to changes in the discount rate is to be recognized in OCI.  The update simplifies the amortization of DAC and other balances amortized in proportion to premiums, gross profits, or gross margins, requiring such balances to be amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the 154 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS contracts. Deferred costs are required to be written off for unexpected contract terminations but are not subject to impairment testing.  The update requires certain contract features meeting the definition of market risk benefits to be measured at fair value. Among the features included in this definition are the GLWB and GMDB riders attached to annuity products. The change in fair value of the market risk benefits is to be recognized in net income, excluding the portion attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk which is recognized in OCI.  The update also introduces disclosure requirements around the liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, separate account liabilities, and deferred acquisition costs. This includes disaggregated rollforwards of these balances and information about significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in their measurement. The Company adopted these updates on January 1, 2023 and, for all provisions of the update, applied a retrospective transition approach using a transition date of January 1, 2022, the date of the Mergers. At the acquisition date, VOBA balances were established as the difference between the fair value of the liabilities and the reserves established as of this date. Upon transition to LDTI, the liability for future policy benefits and contractual features that meet the criteria for market risk benefits were adjusted to conform to LDTI, with an offsetting adjustment made to positive or negative VOBA. No adjustments were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) or retained earnings. See notes 3 and 24 for the effects of LDTI adoption on the 2022 consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations  Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08) In October 2021, the FASB issued guidance to add contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination to the list of exceptions to the fair value recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations, and instead require them to be accounted for in accordance with revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023 and applied prospectively. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)  Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06, ASU 2021-01, ASU 2020-04) The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 and elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications, hedge accounting relationships, and derivative modifications pertaining to discounting, margining, or contract price alignment. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform, and these elections did not have, and are not expected to have, a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2022-06 amended and deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which the Company will no longer be permitted to apply the expedients provided in Topic 848. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of reference rate reform on contract modifications and hedging relationships. Significant Accounting Policies  Asset Management U.S. Treasury Securities, at fair value U.S. Treasury securities, at fair value includes U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities greater than three months when purchased. These securities are recorded at fair value in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest income on such securities is separately presented from the overall change in fair value and is recognized in interest income for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations. Any remaining change in fair value of such securities, that is not recognized as interest income, is recognized in net gains (losses) from investment activities for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations. Due from/to Related Parties Due from/to related parties includes amounts due from and due to existing employees, certain former employees, portfolio companies of the funds and non-consolidated funds. 155 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred Revenue Apollo records deferred revenue, which is a type of contract liability, when consideration is received in advance of management services provided. Deferred revenue is reversed and recognized as revenue over the period that the agreed upon services are performed. It is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Apollo also earns management fees which are subject to an offset. When Apollo receives cash for advisory and transaction fees, a certain percentage of such advisory and/or transaction fees, as applicable, is allocated as a credit to reduce future management fees, otherwise payable by the relevant fund. Such credit is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated statements of financial condition within the accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities line item. A portion of any excess advisory and transaction fees may be required to be returned to the limited partners of certain funds upon such funds liquidation. As the management fees earned by Apollo are presented on a gross basis, any management fee offsets calculated are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, Apollo earns advisory fees pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreements with certain of the portfolio companies that are owned by the funds Apollo manages. When Apollo receives a payment from a portfolio company that exceeds the advisory fees earned at that point in time, the excess payment is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The advisory agreements with the portfolio companies vary in duration and the associated fees are received monthly, quarterly, or annually. Deferred revenue is reversed and recognized as revenue over the period that the agreed upon services are performed. There was $ 172 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 that was previously deferred as of January 1, 2023. Under the terms of the funds partnership agreements, Apollo is normally required to bear organizational expenses over a set dollar amount and placement fees or costs in connection with the offering and sale of interests in the funds it manages to investors. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract and amortized over the life of the customer contract. Capitalized placement fees are recorded within other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition, while amortization is recorded within general, administrative and other in the consolidated statements of operations. In certain instances, the placement fees are paid over a period of time. Based on the management agreements with the funds, Apollo considers placement fees and organizational costs paid in determining if cash has been received in excess of the management fees earned. Placement fees and organizational costs are normally the obligation of Apollo but can be paid for by the funds. When these costs are paid by the fund, the resulting obligations are included within deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance will also be reduced during future periods when management fees are earned but not paid. Redeemable non-controlling interests Redeemable non-controlling interests are attributable to VIEs and primarily represent the shares issued by the Companys consolidated SPACs whose shares are redeemable for cash by the respective public shareholders in connection with the applicable SPACs failure to complete a business combination or its tender offer/stockholder approval provisions. The redeemable non-controlling interests are initially recorded at their original issue price, net of issuance costs and the initial fair value of separately traded warrants. The carrying amount is accreted to its redemption value over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument. The accretion to redemption value is generally recorded against additional paid-in capital. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our consolidated SPACs were liquidated in accordance with their governing documents, and all of their outstanding shares were redeemed. Refer to note 19 for further detail. Revenues The revenues of the asset management business include (i) management fees; (ii) advisory and transaction fees, net; (iii) investment income, which is comprised of performance allocations and principal investment income; and (iv) incentive fees. 156 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The revenue guidance requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services ( i.e. , the transaction price). When determining the transaction price under the revenue guidance, an entity may recognize variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable to not be significantly reversed. The revenue guidance also requires disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. Performance allocations are accounted for under guidance applicable to equity method investments, and therefore not within the scope of the revenue guidance. Apollo recognizes performance allocations within investment income along with the related principal investment income (as further described below) in the consolidated statements of operations and within the investments line in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Refer to disclosures below for additional information on each of the revenue streams of the asset management business. Management Fees Management fees are recognized over time during the periods in which the related services are performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the related agreement. Management fees are generally based on (1) a percentage of the capital committed during the commitment period, and thereafter based on the remaining invested capital of unrealized investments, or (2) net asset value, gross assets or as otherwise provided in the respective agreements. Included in management fees are certain expense reimbursements where Apollo is considered the principal under the agreements and is required to record the expense and related reimbursement revenue on a gross basis. Advisory and Transaction Fees, Net Advisory fees, including management consulting fees and directors fees, are generally recognized over time as the underlying services are provided in accordance with the contractual terms of the related agreement. Apollo receives such fees in exchange for ongoing management consulting services provided to portfolio companies of funds it manages. Transaction fees, including structuring fees and arranging fees related to Apollos funds, portfolio companies of funds and third parties are generally recognized at a point in time when the underlying services rendered are complete. The amounts due from fund portfolio companies are recorded in due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable broken deal costs. Advisory and transaction fees are reduced by these management fee offsets in the consolidated statements of operations. Underwriting fees, which are also included within advisory and transaction fees, net, include gains, losses and fees, arising from securities offerings in which one of the Companys subsidiaries participates in the underwriter syndicate. Underwriting fees are recognized at a point in time when the underwriting is completed. Underwriting fees recognized but not received are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. During the normal course of business, Apollo incurs certain costs related to certain transactions that are not consummated, or broken deal costs. These costs ( e.g. , research costs, due diligence costs, professional fees, legal fees and other related items) are determined to be broken deal costs upon managements decision to no longer pursue the transaction. In accordance with the related fund agreement, in the event the deal is deemed broken, all of the costs are reimbursed by the funds and then included as a component of the calculation of the management fee offset. If a deal is successfully completed, Apollo is reimbursed by the fund or funds portfolio company for all costs incurred and no offset is generated. As Apollo acts as an agent for the funds it manages, any transaction costs incurred and paid by Apollo on behalf of the respective funds relating to successful or broken deals are recorded net on the Companys consolidated statements of operations, and any receivable from the respective funds is recorded in due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investment Income Investment income is comprised of performance allocations and principal investment income. 157 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Performance Allocations. Performance allocations are a type of performance revenue ( i.e. , income earned based on the extent to which an entitys performance exceeds predetermined thresholds). Performance allocations are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital in which Apollos capital account receives allocations of the returns of an entity when those returns exceed predetermined thresholds. The determination of which performance revenues are considered performance allocations is primarily based on the terms of an agreement with the entity. Apollo recognizes performance allocations within investment income along with the related principal investment income (as described further below) in the consolidated statements of operations and within the investments line in the consolidated statements of financial condition. When applicable, Apollo may record a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations. The general partner obligation is based upon an assumed liquidation of a funds net assets as of the reporting date and is reported within due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of a funds investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund. Principal Investment Income. Principal investment income includes Apollos income or loss from equity method investments and certain other investments in entities in which Apollo is generally eligible to receive performance allocations. Income from equity method investments includes Apollos share of net income or loss generated from its investments, which are not consolidated, but in which it exerts significant influence. Incentive Fees Incentive fees are a type of performance revenue. Incentive fees differ from performance allocations in that incentive fees do not represent an allocation of capital but rather a contractual fee arrangement with the entity. Incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration as they are subject to clawback or reversal and therefore must be deferred until the fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. Accrued but unpaid incentive fees are reported within other assets in Apollos consolidated statements of financial condition. Apollos incentive fees are generally received from CLOs, managed accounts and certain other vehicles it manages. Profit Sharing Profit sharing expense and profit sharing payable primarily consist of a portion of performance revenues earned from certain funds that are allocated to employees and former employees. Profit sharing amounts are recognized as the related performance revenues are earned. Accordingly, profit sharing amounts can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance revenues that were previously recognized. Profit sharing expense is recorded in compensation and benefits for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations. Profit sharing payable is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities for Asset Management in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Profit sharing amounts are generally not paid until the related performance revenue is distributed to the general partner upon realization of the funds investments. Under certain profit-sharing arrangements, Apollo requires that a portion of certain of the performance revenues distributed to its employees be used to purchase restricted common stock issued under the Equity Plan. Prior to distribution of the performance revenue, the Company records the value of the equity-based awards expected to be granted in other assets and other liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such equity-based awards are recorded as equity-based compensation expense over the relevant service period once granted. Additionally, profit sharing amounts previously distributed may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the funds were to be liquidated based on the fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the final disposition of a funds investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund. Profit sharing payable also includes contingent consideration obligations that were recognized in connection with certain acquisitions. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation and benefits for asset management. 158 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Apollo has performance-based incentive arrangements for certain employees designed to more closely align compensation on an annual basis with the overall realized performance of the Companys asset management business. These arrangements enable certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on performance revenue earned by Apollos asset management business in a given year, which amounts are reflected in compensation and benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for asset management. Apollo may also use dividends it receives from investments in certain perpetual capital vehicles to compensate employees. These amounts are recorded as compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations for asset management. Other Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in Apollos investments, at fair value between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Income (Loss), Net Other income (loss), net includes the recognition of gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, gains arising from the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability (see note 19), and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses. Significant Accounting Policies  Retirement Services Investments Fixed Maturity Securities Fixed maturity securities includes bonds, CLOs, ABS, RMBS, CMBS and redeemable preferred stock. Athene classifies fixed maturity securities as AFS or trading at the time of purchase and subsequently carries them at fair value. Classification is dependent on a variety of factors, including expected holding period, election of the fair value option and asset and liability matching. AFS Securities AFS securities are held at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with unrealized gains and losses, exclusive of allowances for expected credit losses, generally reflected in AOCI on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships are reflected in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Trading Securities The fair value option is elected for certain fixed maturity securities. These fixed maturity securities are classified as trading, with changes to fair value included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Although the securities are classified as trading, the trading activity related to these investments is primarily focused on asset and liability matching activities and is not intended to be an income strategy based on active trading. As such, the activity related to these investments on the consolidated statements of cash flows is classified as investing activities. Transactions in trading securities are generally recorded on a trade date basis, with any unsettled trades recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Bank loans, private placements and investment funds are recorded on settlement date basis. 159 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Equity Securities Equity securities includes common stock, mutual funds and non-redeemable preferred stock. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. Athene has elected to account for certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair values based on NAV per share (or its equivalent) at cost less impairment, subject to adjustments based on observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Purchased Credit Deteriorated Investments Athene purchases certain structured securities, primarily RMBS, which upon assessment have been determined to meet the definition of PCD investments. Additionally, structured securities classified as beneficial interests follow the initial measurement guidance for PCD investments if there is a significant difference between contractual cash flows adjusted for expected prepayments and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. The initial allowance for credit losses for PCD investments is recorded through a gross-up adjustment to the initial amortized cost. For structured securities classified as beneficial interests, the initial allowance is calculated as the present value of the difference between contractual cash flows adjusted for expected prepayments and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. The non-credit purchase discount or premium is amortized into investment income using the effective interest method. The credit discount, represented by the allowance for expected credit losses, is remeasured each period following the policies for measuring credit losses described in Credit Losses  Available-for-Sale Securitie s section below. Mortgage Loans Athene elected the fair value option on its mortgage loan portfolio. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on its contractual interest rate. Interest is accrued on loans until it is probable it will not be received, or the loan is 90 days past due, unless guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Interest income and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Investment Funds Athene invests in certain non-fixed income, alternative investments in the form of limited partnerships or similar legal structures (investment funds). For investment funds in which it does not hold a controlling financial interest, Athene typically accounts for such investments using the equity method, where the cost is recorded as an investment in the fund, or it has elected the fair value option. Adjustments to the carrying amount reflect pro rata ownership percentage of the operating results as indicated by NAV in the investment fund financial statements, which can be on a lag of up to three months when investee information is not received in a timely manner. Athenes proportionate share of investment fund income is recorded within net investment income, or, for consolidated VIEs, revenues of consolidated VIEs, on the consolidated statements of operations. Contributions paid or distributions received by Athene are recorded directly to the investment fund balance as an increase to carrying value or as a return of capital, respectively. Policy Loans Policy loans are funds provided to policyholders in return for a claim on the policyholders account balance. The funds provided are limited to a specified percentage of the account balance. The majority of policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid with proceeds from the policyholders account balance. Policy loans are reported at the unpaid principal balance. Interest income is recorded as earned using the contract interest rate and is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Funds Withheld at Interest Funds withheld at interest represents a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with funds withheld coinsurance (funds withheld) and modified coinsurance (modco) reinsurance agreements in which Athene is 160 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company, and any excess or shortfall is settled periodically. The underlying agreements contain embedded derivatives as discussed below. Short-term Investments Short-term investments consist of financial instruments with maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months when purchased. Short-term debt securities are accounted for as trading or AFS consistent with the policies for those investments. Short-term loans are carried at amortized cost. Other Investments Other investments includes, but is not limited to, term loans collateralized by mortgages on residential and commercial real estate and other uncollateralized loans. Athene elected the fair value option on these loans. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on its contractual interest rate. Interest on loans is accrued until it is probable it will not be received or the loan is 90 days past due. Interest income and prepayment and other fees are reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Investment Income Investment income is recognized as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined based on a first-in first-out method. Credit Losses  Available-for-Sale Securities AFS securities with a fair value that has declined below amortized cost are evaluated to determine how the decline in fair value should be recognized. If based on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security, Athene intends to sell a security or it is more likely than not that it would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, any existing allowance for expected credit losses is reversed and the amortized cost of the security is written down to fair value. If neither of these conditions exist, the decline in fair value is evaluated to determine whether it has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. For non-structured AFS securities, relevant facts and circumstances are qualitatively considered in evaluating whether a decline below fair value is credit-related. Relevant facts and circumstances include but are not limited to: (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost; (2) changes in agency credit ratings, (3) adverse conditions related to the securitys industry or geographical area, (4) failure to make scheduled payments, and (5) other known changes in the financial condition of the issuer or quality of any underlying collateral or credit enhancements. For structured AFS securities meeting the definition of beneficial interests, the qualitative assessment is bypassed, and any securities having experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost move directly to a quantitative analysis. If upon completion of this analysis it is determined that a potential credit loss exists, an allowance for expected credit losses is established equal to the amount by which the present value of expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, limited by the amount by which fair value is less than amortized cost. A non-structured securitys cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using security-specific facts and circumstances, including timing, security interests and loss severity. A structured securitys cash flow estimates are based on security-specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity, prepayments and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. The expected cash flows are discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete a structured security. For securities with a contractual interest rate that varies based on changes in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the effective interest rate is calculated based on the factor as it changes over the life of the security. Inherently under the discounted cash flow model, both the timing and amount of expected cash flows affect the measurement of the allowance for expected credit losses. 161 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The allowance for expected credit losses is remeasured each period for the passage of time, any change in expected cash flows, and changes in the fair value of the security. All impairments, whether intent or requirement to sell or credit-related, are recorded through a charge to the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. All changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. It has also elected the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost balance used to calculate the allowance for expected credit losses, as it has a policy to write off such balances in a timely manner, when they become 90 days past due. Any write-off of accrued interest is recorded through a reversal of net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Upon determining that all or a portion of the amortized cost of an asset is uncollectible, which is generally when all efforts for collection are exhausted, the amortized cost is written off against the existing allowance. Any write off in excess of the existing allowance is recorded through the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Derivative Instruments Athene invests in derivatives to hedge the risks experienced from ongoing operations, such as equity, interest rate and cash flow risks, or for other risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing liability risks associated with indexed annuity products and reinsurance agreements. Derivatives are financial instruments with values that are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or other combinations of an underlying and notional. Derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company elects to present any derivatives subject to master netting provisions as a gross asset or liability and gross of collateral. It may designate derivatives as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Hedge Documentation and Hedge Effectiveness To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, Athene formally documents its designation of the hedge as a cash flow, fair value or net investment hedge and risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. This documentation identifies how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedge effectiveness and the method which will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the hedge accounting relationship. For a cash flow hedge, all changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are reported within AOCI and the related gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations when the cash flows of the hedged item affect earnings. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged are reported on the consolidated statements of operations according to the nature of the risk being hedged. Additionally, changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in AOCI and amortized into income over the life of the hedge accounting relationship. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are reported within AOCI to offset the translation adjustments for subsidiaries with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar. Athene discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated cash flows or fair value of a hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; or (3) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. For a derivative not designated as a hedge, changes in the derivatives fair value and any income received or paid on derivatives at the settlement date are included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. 162 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Embedded Derivatives Athene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If it determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract. Under the fair value option, bifurcation of the embedded derivative is not necessary as the entire contract is carried at fair value with all related gains and losses recognized in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Embedded derivatives are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value in the same line item as the host contract. Fixed indexed annuity, index-linked variable annuity and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates and policyholder behavior assumptions, including lapses and the use of benefit riders. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athenes own credit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policys life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date. Changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with fixed indexed annuities, index-linked variable annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts are included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, reinsurance agreements written on a funds withheld or modco basis contain embedded derivatives. Athene has determined that the right to receive or obligation to pay the total return on the assets supporting the funds withheld at interest or funds withheld liability, respectively, represents a total return swap with a floating rate leg. The fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld and modco agreements is computed as the unrealized gain (loss) on the underlying assets and is included within funds withheld at interest for assumed agreements, and for ceded agreements the funds withheld liability is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Assumed and ceded earnings from funds withheld at interest, funds withheld liability and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives are reported in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contributions to and withdrawals from funds withheld at interest and funds withheld liability are reported in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Reinsurance Athene assumes and cedes insurance and investment contracts under coinsurance, funds withheld, modco, and yearly renewable term basis. Reinsurance accounting is applied for transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must transfer insurance risk arising from uncertainties about both underwriting and timing risks. Cessions under reinsurance do not discharge obligations as the primary insurer, unless the requirements of assumption reinsurance have been met. Athene generally has the right of offset on reinsurance transactions, but has elected to present reinsurance settlement amounts due to and from Athene on a gross basis. For assets and liabilities ceded under reinsurance agreements, Athene generally applies the same measurement guidance for Athenes directly issued or assumed contracts. Ceded amounts are recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. For reinsurance of in-force contracts that pass risk transfer, the issue year used for the purpose of measuring the reinsurance recoverable is dependent on the effective date of the reinsurance agreement, which may differ from the issue year for the direct or assumed contract. The issue year informs the locked-in discount rate used for the purposes of interest accretion. This may result in different discount rates used for the direct or assumed reserves and ceded reserves when reinsuring an in-force block of insurance contracts. For flow reinsurance of insurance contracts that pass risk transfer, the contracts have the same cash flow assumptions as the direct or assumed contracts when the terms are consistent between those respective contracts and the ceded reinsurance agreement. When Athene recognizes an immediate loss due to the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeding the present value of future gross premiums, a gain is recognized on the corresponding reinsurance recoverable to the extent it does not result in gain recognition at treaty inception. Likewise, where the direct or 163 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS assumed reserve has been floored to zero, the corresponding reinsurance recoverable will be consistently set to zero. See Future Policy Benefits below for further information. Accounting for reinsurance requires the use of assumptions, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. Athene attempts to minimize its counterparty credit risk through the structuring of the terms of its reinsurance agreements, including the use of trusts, and monitors credit ratings of counterparties for signs of declining credit quality. When a ceding company does not report information on a timely basis, Athene records accruals based on the best available information at the time, which includes the reinsurance agreement terms and historical experience. Athene periodically compares actual and anticipated experience to the assumptions used to establish reinsurance assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities assumed or ceded under coinsurance, funds withheld, modco, or yearly renewable term are presented gross on the consolidated statements of financial condition. For investment contracts, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves are presented net in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. For insurance contracts, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves and benefits are presented net in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations, except any changes related to the discount rate are presented net in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For market risk benefits, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves are presented net in market risk benefits remeasurement (gain) loss on the consolidated statements of operations, except for changes related to instrument-specific credit risk on direct and assumed contracts which are presented net in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For the reinsurance of existing in-force blocks that transfer significant insurance risk, the difference between the assets received or paid and the liabilities assumed or ceded represents the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (DSI), or on a consistent basis with deferred profit liability dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract. Deferred Acquisition Costs, Deferred Sales Inducements and Value of Business Acquired Deferred Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements Costs related directly to the successful acquisition of new, or the renewal of existing, insurance or investment contracts are deferred. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances, and are included in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These costs are not capitalized until they are incurred. Deferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type and amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. The cohorts and assumptions used for the amortization of deferred costs are consistent with those used in estimating the related liabilities for these contracts. The constant level basis generally is the initial premium or deposit and is projected based on assumptions related to policyholder behavior, including lapses and mortality, over the expected term of the contracts. Each reporting period, Athene replaces expected experience with actual experience to determine the related amortization expense. Changes to projected experience are recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining contract term. Amortization of DAC and DSI is included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method amortizes the deferred costs by discounting the future liability cash flows at a break-even rate. The break-even rate is solved for such that the present value of future liability cash flows is equal to the net liability at the inception of the contract. The deferred costs represent the difference between the net and gross liability and the change relates to amortization for the period. Value of Business Acquired Athene establishes VOBA for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the acquisition of insurance entities. It records the fair value of the liabilities assumed in two components: reserves and VOBA. Reserves are established using Athenes best 164 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS estimate assumptions as of the business combination date. VOBA is the difference between the fair value of the liabilities and the reserves. VOBA can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions that impact VOBA amortization are consistent with those that impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities. Athene performs periodic tests to determine if positive VOBA remains recoverable. If Athene determines that positive VOBA is not recoverable, Athene records a cumulative charge to the current period. Any negative VOBA is recorded to the same financial statement line on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the associated reserves. Positive VOBA is recorded in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities Universal life-type policies and investment contracts include traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed and index-linked variable annuities in the accumulation phase, funding agreements, immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which include pension group annuities without life contingencies), universal life insurance, and other investment contracts inclusive of assumed endowments without significant mortality risk. Athene carries liabilities for traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities, funding agreements and universal life insurance at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (together with its subsidiaries, Global Atlantic), which it carries at fair value. Liabilities for immediate annuities without significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest rates. Certain of Athenes universal life-type policies and investment contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit. See Market Risk Benefits below for further information. Unearned revenue liabilities are established when amounts are assessed against the policyholder for services to be provided in future periods. These balances are amortized consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI. Changes in interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest sensitive contract liabilities are not reduced for amounts ceded under reinsurance agreements which are reported as reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Future Policy Benefits Athene issues contracts classified as long-duration, which include term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which include pension group annuities with life contingencies). Liabilities for non-participating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits we expect to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected, referred to as the net premium ratio. The contracts are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type, with an exception for pension group annuities, which are generally assessed at the group annuity contract level. Contracts with different issuance years are not combined. Contracts acquired in a business combination are grouped into a single cohort by contract type, except for pension group annuities, which follow the group annuity contract level. Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses, longevity, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other policyholder behavior. Athene bases certain key assumptions, such as longevity, mortality and morbidity, on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if needed. Athene has elected to use expense assumptions that are locked in at issuance for each cohort. All other cash flow assumptions are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually or more frequently if actual experience suggests a revision is necessary. The effects of changes in cash flow assumptions impacting the net premium ratio are recorded as remeasurement changes in the period in which they are made. As cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually, there is no provision for adverse deviation included within the liability. Actual experience is recognized in the period in which the experience arises. Actual experience is then incorporated into the net premium ratio for all products and cohorts on a quarterly basis. When the net premium ratio is revised, whether to incorporate actual experience each reporting period or for the review of cash flow assumptions, the liability is recalculated as of the beginning of the period, discounted at the original contract issuance discount rate, and compared with the carrying amount of 165 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the liability as of the same date to determine the current period change. The current period change in the liability is recognized as remeasurement gain or loss. To the extent the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeds the present value of gross premiums, Athene will cap the net premium ratio at one hundred percent by increasing the corresponding liability and recognizing an immediate loss through the consolidated statements of operations. The liability is never recorded at an amount less than zero for the cohort. The liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows. In determining reference portfolio of instruments, Athene has used a single A equivalent level rate and maximized the use of observable data to the extent possible for the duration of its liabilities. The discount rate is required to be updated at the end of each reporting period for the remeasurement of the liability but is locked-in for each cohort for the purpose of interest accretion expense. Changes in the value of the liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts due to changes in the discount rate are recognized as a component of OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the liability for remeasurement gains or losses and all other changes in the liability are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Future policy benefits include liabilities for no-lapse guarantees on universal life insurance and fixed indexed universal life insurance. Athene establishes future policy benefits for no-lapse guarantees by estimating the expected value of death benefits paid after policyholder account balances have been exhausted. Athene recognizes these benefits proportionally over the life of the contracts based on total actual and expected assessments. The methods Athene uses to estimate the liabilities have assumptions about policyholder behavior, mortality, expected yield on investments supporting the liability and market conditions affecting policyholder account balance growth. For the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees, each reporting period Athene updates expected excess benefits and assessments with actual excess benefits and assessments and adjusts the liability balances due to the OCI effects of unrealized investment gains and losses on AFS securities. Athene also periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities that result in revisions to the expected excess benefits and assessments. The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made. Changes in the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees, other than the adjustment for the OCI effects of unrealized investment gains and losses on AFS securities, are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Future policy benefits are not reduced for amounts ceded under reinsurance agreements which are reported as reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Market Risk Benefits Market risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athenes deferred annuity contracts which contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset, which are recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition in market risk benefits or other assets, respectively. Multiple market risk benefits on a contract are treated as a single, compound market risk benefit. At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder. If the fees are sufficient to cover the projected benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used. If the fees are insufficient to cover the projected benefits, an option-based valuation model is used to compute the market risk benefit liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits are recorded in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, excluding portions attributed to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, which are recorded in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Market risk benefits are not reduced for 166 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS market risk benefits ceded under reinsurance agreements. Ceded market risk benefits are measured at fair value and recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Upon annuitization of the contract or the extinguishment of the account balance, the market risk benefit, related annuity contract and unamortized deferred costs are derecognized, including amounts within AOCI. A payout annuity is then established for GLWBs. Revenues Revenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and the change in fair value of embedded derivatives within fixed indexed annuity contracts is included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Premiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established equal to the excess of the gross premium over the net premium. The deferred profit liability is recognized in future policy benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition and amortized into income in relation to either applicable policyholder liabilities for immediate annuities with life contingencies (which includes pension group annuities) or insurance in-force for whole life products through future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. When the net premium ratio for the corresponding future policy benefit is updated for actual experience and changes to projected cash flow assumptions, the deferred profit liability is retrospectively recalculated from the contract issuance date through the beginning of the current reporting period. The revised deferred profit liability is compared to the beginning of the period carrying amount to determine the change to be recognized as a remeasurement gain or loss within future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Unlike the related future policy benefit, the deferred profit liability will not be remeasured for changes in discount rates each reporting period. Negative VOBA balances associated with payout contracts involving life contingencies, including pension group annuities, are accounted for in a manner similar to the deferred profit liability. All insurance-related revenue is reported net of reinsurance ceded. 3.

Adjustments to the deferred profit liability were not required as these balances were set to zero on the Merger Date. Since the liability for future policy benefits was measured at fair value on the Merger Date, there were no instances upon transition in which net premiums exceeded gross premiums which would have required an immediate loss to be recognized in net income. 167 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

As a result of the Mergers, AAM and AHL became subsidiaries of AGM. Under the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding Athene common share was converted automatically into 1.149 shares of common stock of AGM and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The purchase price was as follows: (In millions, except share price data and exchange ratio) AHL common shares purchased 138 Exchange ratio 1.149 Shares of common stock issued in exchange 158 AGM Class A shares closing price $ 72.43 Total merger consideration at closing $ 11,455 Fair value of estimated RSUs, options and warrants assumed and other equity consideration 1,2 699 Effective settlement of pre-existing relationships 3 896 Total merger consideration 13,050 Fair value of AHL common shares previously held ( 55 million shares) and other adjustments 4,5 4,554 Total AHL equity value held by AGM 17,604 Non-controlling interest 6 4,942 Total AHL equity value $ 22,546 1 AGM issued one-time grants of fully vested RSUs and options to certain executives and stockholders of Athene vesting upon consummation of the Mergers. Additionally, all issued and outstanding warrants of Athene prior to the Merger Date were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock at the time of the Mergers. The fair value of these awards is $ 600 million and is treated as part of consideration transferred. 2 AGM issued replacement awards for all outstanding Athene equity awards. $ 99 million was included as part of consideration for the portion that was attributable to pre-combination services and $ 53 million will be treated as post-combination compensation expense. 3 The pre-existing relationship related to receivables, payables, and dividends between Apollo and Athene. Total fees payable to AGM by Athene for asset management and advisory services were approximately $ 146 million. A cash dividend of $ 750 million was declared by Athene to its common stockholders with Apollo owning 100 % of the common shares as of the dividend record date. 4 Based on the December 31, 2021 closing price of AHL common shares on the NYSE. 5 Other adjustments includes pushdown of goodwill arising out of deferred tax liabilities associated with identifiable net assets of Athene. 6 Non-controlling interest in Athene includes holders of Athenes preferred shares and third-party investors in ACRA 1 and in consolidated VIEs of Athene. The fair value of Athenes preferred shares was based on the closing stock price of Athenes preferred shares immediately prior to the consummation of the Athene merger and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in ACRA 1 was determined using the discounted distribution model approach. The Mergers were accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to Athene's assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values as of the Merger Date. The business combination was achieved in steps. The Company previously held its equity interests in the acquiree at fair value. Goodwill of $ 4.1 billion was recorded based on the amount that the Athene equity value exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired less the amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations, and synergies that can be achieved subsequent to the Mergers. The goodwill recorded is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill on the consolidated statements of financial position includes the impacts of foreign currency translation. The financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the changes to the provisional values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that occurred in subsequent periods. Adjustments were recognized as information related to the preliminary fair value calculation was obtained. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, as a result of changes to the provisional amounts, were recorded in the same period as the financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the Merger Date. 171 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded adjustments which decreased provisional goodwill by $ 108 million. The adjustments were comprised of $ 25 million for measurement period adjustments and $ 83 million to adjust the valuation of an investment. The measurement period adjustments were primarily related to decreases in interest sensitive contract liabilities and future policy benefits and the effects to the consolidated statements of operations were immaterial to those periods. The Company performed a valuation of the acquired investments, policy liabilities, VOBA, other identifiable intangibles, and funds withheld at interest payables and receivables using methodologies consistent with those described in note 2 and note 8. Value of business acquired and Other identifiable intangible assets VOBA represents the difference between the fair value of liabilities acquired and reserves established using best estimate assumptions at the Merger Date. Other identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition and summarized as follows: Distribution Channels Trade Name Insurance Licenses These assets are valued using the excess earnings method, which derives value based on the present value of the cash flow attributable to the distribution channels, less returns for contributory assets. Amortization of these assets is on a straight-line basis. This represents the Athene trade name and was valued using the relief-from-royalty method considering publicly available third-party trade name royalty rates as well as expected premiums generated by the use of the trade name over its anticipated life. Amortization of this asset is on a straight-line basis. Licenses are protected through registration and were valued using the market approach based on third-party market transactions from which the prices paid for state insurance licenses could be derived. These assets are not amortized. 172 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

Fair Value Hedges Athene uses foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate swaps that are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The foreign currency forward price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment is made at a specified future date.

During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no amounts deemed ineffective. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Equity options Athene uses equity indexed options to economically hedge fixed indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specified market index, primarily the S&P 500. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, Athene enters into contracts to buy equity indexed options. The contracts are net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. 186 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Futures Athene purchases futures contracts to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices. Athene enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission clearing brokers who are members of a trading exchange. Under exchange-traded futures contracts, Athene agrees to purchase a specified number of contracts with other parties and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily fair values of those contracts. Interest rate swaps Athene uses interest rate swaps to reduce market risks from interest rate changes and to alter interest rate exposure arising from duration mismatches between assets and liabilities. With an interest rate swap, Athene agrees with another party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts tied to an agreed upon notional principal amount at specified intervals. Other swaps Other swaps include total return swaps, credit default swaps and swaptions. Athene purchases total rate of return swaps to gain exposure and benefit from a reference asset or index without ownership. Credit default swaps provide a measure of protection against the default of an issuer or allow us to gain credit exposure to an issuer or traded index. Athene uses credit default swaps coupled with a bond to synthetically create the characteristics of a reference bond. Embedded derivatives Athene has embedded derivatives which are required to be separated from their host contracts and reported as derivatives. Host contracts include reinsurance agreements structured on a modco or funds withheld basis and indexed annuity products. The following is a summary of the gains (losses) related to derivatives not designated as hedges: Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 Equity options $ 1,564 $ ( 2,647 ) Futures 73 ( 144 ) Swaps ( 108 ) 56 Foreign currency forwards ( 495 ) 505 Embedded derivatives on funds withheld 934 ( 6,534 ) Amounts recognized in investment related gains (losses) 1,968 ( 8,764 ) Embedded derivatives in indexed annuity products 1 ( 1,443 ) 2,768 Total gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges $ 525 $ ( 5,996 ) 1 Included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Credit Risk The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance on derivative financial instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of Athenes derivative contracts is the fair value at the reporting date less any collateral received from the counterparty. Athene manages credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties. Where possible, Athene maintains collateral arrangements and uses master netting agreements that provide for a single net payment from one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. Athene has also established counterparty exposure limits, where possible, in order to evaluate if there is sufficient collateral to support the net exposure. Collateral arrangements typically require the posting of collateral in connection with its derivative instruments. Collateral agreements often contain posting thresholds, some of which may vary depending on the posting partys financial strength 187 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ratings. Additionally, a decrease in Athenes financial strength rating to a specified level can result in settlement of the derivative position. The estimated fair value of net derivative and other financial assets and liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows: Gross amounts not offset on the consolidated statements of financial condition (In millions) Gross amount recognized 1 Financial instruments 2 Collateral (received)/pledged Net amount Off-balance sheet securities collateral 3 Net amount after securities collateral December 31, 2023 Derivative assets $ 5,298 $ ( 1,497 ) $ ( 3,676 ) $ 125 $  $ 125 Derivative liabilities ( 1,995 ) 1,497 848 350  350 December 31, 2022 Derivative assets $ 3,309 $ ( 1,477 ) $ ( 1,952 ) $ ( 120 ) $  $ ( 120 ) Derivative liabilities ( 1,646 ) 1,477 478 309  309 1 The gross amounts of recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounts not subject to master netting or similar agreements were immaterial. 2 Represents amounts offsetting derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement or similar agreement that are not netted against the gross derivative assets or gross derivative liabilities for presentation on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 3 For non-cash collateral received, the Company does not recognize the collateral on the consolidated statements of financial condition unless the obligor (transferor) has defaulted under the terms of the secured contract and is no longer entitled to redeem the pledged asset. Amounts do not include any excess of collateral pledged or received. 7. Variable Interest Entities A variable interest in a VIE is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of the VIEs expected losses and/or receive expected residual returns. Refer to note 2 for more details about the Companys VIE assessment and consolidation policy. Variable interests in consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs are discussed separately below. Consolidated VIEs Consolidated VIEs include consolidated SPACs as well as certain CLOs and funds managed by the Company. See note 19 for further details regarding Apollos previously consolidated SPACs. The assets of consolidated VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company, and the investors in these consolidated VIEs have no recourse against the assets of the Company. Similarly, there is no recourse to the Company for the consolidated VIEs liabilities. Other assets of the consolidated funds include interest receivables, receivables from affiliates and reverse repurchase agreements. Other liabilities include debt, short-term payables and repurchase agreements. Each series of notes in a respective consolidated VIE participates in distributions from the VIE, including principal and interest from underlying investments. Amounts allocated to the noteholders reflect amounts that would be distributed if the VIEs affairs were wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their respective carrying values, its liabilities satisfied in accordance with their terms, and all the remaining amounts distributed to the noteholders. The respective VIEs that issue the notes payable are marked at their prevailing net asset value, which approximates fair value. Results from certain funds managed by Apollo are reported on a three-month lag based upon the availability of financial information. 188 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

(In millions) December 31, 2023 2 December 31, 2022 2 Maximum Loss Exposure 1 $ 325 $ 343 1 Represents Apollos direct investment in those entities in which it holds a significant variable interest and certain other investments. Additionally, cumulative performance allocations are subject to reversal in the event of future losses. 2 Some amounts included are a quarter in arrears. Unconsolidated Variable Interest EntitiesRetirement Services The Company has variable interests in certain unconsolidated VIEs in the form of securities and ownership stakes in investment funds. Fixed maturity securities Athene invests in securitization entities as a debt holder or an investor in the residual interest of the securitization vehicle. These entities are deemed VIEs due to insufficient equity within the structure and lack of control by the equity investors over the activities that significantly impact the economics of the entity. In general, Athene is a debt investor within these entities and, as such, holds a variable interest; however, due to the debt holders lack of ability to control the decisions within the trust that significantly impact the entity, and the fact the debt holders are protected from losses due to the subordination of the equity tranche, the debt holders are not deemed the primary beneficiary. Securitization vehicles in which Athene holds the residual tranche are not consolidated because Athene does not unilaterally have substantive rights to remove the general partner, or when assessing related party interests, Athene is not under common control, as defined by U.S. GAAP, with the related parties, nor are substantially all of the activities conducted on Athenes behalf; therefore, Athene is not deemed the primary beneficiary. Debt investments and investments in the residual tranche of securitization entities are considered debt instruments, and are held at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and classified as AFS or trading. 190 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment funds Investment funds include non-fixed income, alternative investments in the form of limited partnerships or similar legal structures. Equity securities Athene invests in preferred equity securities issued by entities deemed to be VIEs due to insufficient equity within the structure. Athenes risk of loss associated with its non-consolidated investments depends on the investment. Investment funds, equity securities and trading securities are limited to the carrying value plus unfunded commitments. AFS securities are limited to amortized cost plus unfunded commitments.

The financial instruments presented above are reported at carrying value on the consolidated statements of financial condition; however, in the case of policy loans, funds withheld at interest and liability, short-term investments, and securities to repurchase, the carrying amount approximates fair value. Interest sensitive contract liabilities The carrying and fair value of interest sensitive contract liabilities above includes fixed indexed and traditional fixed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks, funding agreements and payout annuities without life contingencies. The embedded derivatives within fixed indexed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks are excluded, as they are carried at fair value. The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates, adding a spread to reflect nonperformance risk and subtracting a risk margin to reflect uncertainty inherent in the projected cash flows. Debt The fair value of debt is obtained from commercial pricing services. These are classified as Level 2. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, trading activity, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, offers and other reference data. Significant Unobservable Inputs Asset Management Discounted Cash Flow and Direct Capitalization Model When a discounted cash flow or direct capitalization model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows or the capitalization rate, respectively. Increases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations. See note 20 for further discussion of the contingent consideration obligations. 204 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Option Model When an option model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the volatility rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the volatility rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations. Consolidated VIEs Investments The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the equity securities, bank loans and bonds is the discount rate applied in the valuation models. This input in isolation can cause significant increases or decreases in fair value, which would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. NAV Certain investments and investments of VIEs are valued using the NAV per share equivalent calculated by the investment manager as a practical expedient to determine an independent fair value. Retirement Services AFS, trading and equity securities Athene uses discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value for certain fixed maturity and equity securities. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input because the credit spread includes adjustments made to the base rate. The base rate represents a market comparable rate for securities with similar characteristics. This excludes assets for which fair value is provided by independent broker quotes. Mortgage loans Athene uses discounted cash flow models from independent commercial pricing services to calculate the fair value of its mortgage loan portfolio. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input. This approach uses market transaction information and client portfolio-oriented information, such as prepayments or defaults, to support the valuations. Interest sensitive contract liabilities  embedded derivative Significant unobservable inputs used in the fixed indexed annuities embedded derivative of the interest sensitive contract liabilities valuation include: 1. Nonperformance risk  For contracts Athene issues, it uses the credit spread, relative to the U.S. Treasury curve based on Athenes public credit rating as of the valuation date. This represents Athenes credit risk for use in the estimate of the fair value of embedded derivatives. 2. Option budget  Athene assumes future hedge costs in the derivatives fair value estimate. The level of option budgets determines the future costs of the options and impacts future policyholder account value growth. 3. Policyholder behavior  Athene regularly reviews the full withdrawal (surrender rate) assumptions. These are based on initial pricing assumptions updated for actual experience. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products. Valuation of Underlying Investments Asset Management As previously noted, the underlying entities that Apollo manages and invests in are primarily investment companies that account for their investments at estimated fair value. On a quarterly basis, valuation committees consisting of members from senior management review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds Apollo manages. Apollo also retains external valuation firms to provide third- 205 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. Apollo performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material. Yield Investments Yield investments are generally valued based on third party vendor prices and/or quoted market prices and valuation models. Valuations using quoted market prices are based on the average of the bid and the ask quotes provided by multiple brokers wherever possible without any adjustments. Apollo will designate certain brokers to use to value specific securities. In determining the designated brokers, Apollo considers the following: (i) brokers with which Apollo has previously transacted, (ii) the underwriter of the security and (iii) active brokers indicating executable quotes. In addition, when valuing a security based on broker quotes wherever possible Apollo tests the standard deviation amongst the quotes received and the variance between the concluded fair value and the value provided by a pricing service. When relying on a third party vendor as a primary source, Apollo (i) analyzes how the price has moved over the measurement period, (ii) reviews the number of brokers included in the pricing services population, if available, and (iii) validates the valuation levels with Apollos pricing team and traders. Debt securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value utilizing a model based approach to determine fair value. Valuation approaches used to estimate the fair value of illiquid credit investments also may include the income approach, as described below. The valuation approaches used consider, as applicable, market risks, credit risks, counterparty risks and foreign currency risks. Equity and Hybrid Investments The majority of illiquid equity and hybrid investments are valued using the market approach and/or the income approach, as described below. Market Approach The market approach is driven by current market conditions, including actual trading levels of similar companies and, to the extent available, actual transaction data of similar companies. Judgment is required by management when assessing which companies are similar to the subject company being valued. Consideration may also be given to any of the following factors: (1) the subject companys historical and projected financial data; (2) valuations given to comparable companies; (3) the size and scope of the subject companys operations; (4) the subject companys individual strengths and weaknesses; (5) expectations relating to the markets receptivity to an offering of the subject companys securities; (6) applicable restrictions on transfer; (7) industry and market information; (8) general economic and market conditions; and (9) other factors deemed relevant. Market approach valuation models typically employ a multiple that is based on one or more of the factors described above. Enterprise value as a multiple of EBITDA is common and relevant for most companies and industries, however, other industry specific multiples are employed where available and appropriate. Sources for gaining additional knowledge related to comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. Once a comparable company set is determined, Apollo reviews certain aspects of the subject companys performance and determines how its performance compares to the group and to certain individuals in the group. Apollo compares certain measurements such as EBITDA margins, revenue growth over certain time periods, leverage ratios and growth opportunities. In addition, Apollo compares the entry multiple and its relation to the comparable set at the time of acquisition to understand its relation to the comparable set on each measurement date. Income Approach The income approach provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business or security is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology for the income approach is a discounted cash flow method. Inherent in the discounted cash flow method are significant assumptions related to the subject companys expected results, the determination of a terminal value and a calculated discount rate, which is normally based on the subject companys WACC. The WACC represents the required rate of return on total capitalization, which is comprised of a required rate of return on equity, plus the current tax-effected rate of return on debt, weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt that are 206 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS typical in the industry. The most critical step in determining the appropriate WACC for each subject company is to select companies that are comparable in nature to the subject company and the credit quality of the subject company. Sources for gaining additional knowledge about the comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. The general formula then used for calculating the WACC considers the after-tax rate of return on debt capital and the rate of return on common equity capital, which further considers the risk-free rate of return, market beta, market risk premium and small stock premium, if applicable. The variables used in the WACC formula are inferred from the comparable market data obtained. The Company evaluates the comparable companies selected and concludes on WACC inputs based on the most comparable company or analyzes the range of data for the investment. The value of liquid investments, where the primary market is an exchange (whether foreign or domestic), is determined using period end market prices. Such prices are generally based on the close price on the date of determination. Certain of the funds Apollo manages may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, total return swap contracts, credit default swap contracts and other derivative contracts, which may include options, caps, collars and floors. Foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. If securities are held at the end of the period, the changes in value are recorded in income as unrealized. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. Total return swap and credit default swap contracts are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized at the termination of the contract based on the difference between the close-out price of the total return or credit default swap contract and the original contract price. Forward contracts are valued based on market rates obtained from counterparties or prices obtained from recognized financial data service providers. Retirement Services NAV Investment funds are typically measured using NAV as a practical expedient in determining fair value and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value reflects a pro rata ownership percentage as indicated by NAV in the investment fund financial statements, which may be adjusted if it is determined NAV is not calculated consistent with investment company fair value principles. The underlying investments of the investment funds may have significant unobservable inputs, which may include but are not limited to, comparable multiples and WACC rates applied in valuation models or a discounted cash flow model. AFS and trading securities The fair value for most marketable securities without an active market are obtained from several commercial pricing services. These are classified as Level 2 assets. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, trading activity, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, offers and other reference data. This category typically includes U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds, U.S. agency and government guaranteed securities, CLO, ABS, CMBS and RMBS. Athene also has fixed maturity securities priced based on indicative broker quotes or by employing market accepted valuation models. For certain fixed maturity securities, the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and are included in Level 3 in fair value hierarchy. Significant unobservable inputs used include discount rates, issue-specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers. These inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants have access to this data. Privately placed fixed maturity securities are valued based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, a matrix-based pricing model is used. These models consider the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. Additional factors such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and Athenes evaluation of the borrowers ability to compete in its relevant market are also considered. Privately placed fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 or 3. 207 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Equity securities Fair values of publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and classified as Level 1. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers, and are classified as Level 2 or 3. Mortgage loans Athene estimates fair value monthly using discounted cash flow analysis and rates being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. The discounted cash flow model uses unobservable inputs, including estimates of discount rates and loan prepayments. Mortgage loans are classified as Level 3. Investment funds Certain investment funds for which Athene has elected the fair value option are included in Level 3 and are priced based on market accepted valuation models. The valuation models use significant unobservable inputs, which include material non-public financial information, estimation of future distributable earnings and demographic assumptions. These inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants have access to this data. Other investments The fair value of other investments are determined using a discounted cash flow model using discount rates for similar investments. Funds withheld at interest embedded derivative Athene estimates the fair value of the embedded derivative based on the change in the fair value of the assets supporting the funds withheld payable under modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements. As a result, the fair value of the embedded derivative is classified as Level 2 or 3 based on the valuation methods used for the assets held supporting the reinsurance agreements. Derivatives Derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter. Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy depending on trading activity. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued using valuation models or an income approach using third-party broker valuations. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlation of the inputs. Athene considers and incorporates counterparty credit risk in the valuation process through counterparty credit rating requirements and monitoring of overall exposure. Athene also evaluates and includes its own nonperformance risk in valuing derivatives. The majority of Athenes derivatives trade in liquid markets; therefore, it can verify model inputs and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. These are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interest sensitive contract liabilities embedded derivative Embedded derivatives related to interest sensitive contract liabilities with fixed indexed annuity products are classified as Level 3. The valuations include significant unobservable inputs associated with economic assumptions and actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior. AmerUs Closed Block Athene elected the fair value option for the future policy benefits liability in the AmerUs Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open blocks obligations to the closed block business. This component is the present value of the projected release of required capital and future earnings before income taxes on required capital supporting the AmerUs Closed Block, discounted at a rate which represents a market participants required rate of return, less the initial required capital. 208 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The AmerUs Closed Block policyholder liabilities and any corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. ILICO Closed Block Athene elected the fair value option for the ILICO Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open blocks obligations to the closed block business. This component uses the present value of future cash flows which include commissions, administrative expenses, reinsurance premiums and benefits, and an explicit cost of capital. The discount rate includes a margin to reflect the business and nonperformance risk. Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The ILICO Closed Block policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. Universal life liabilities and other life benefits Athene elected the fair value option for certain blocks of universal and other life business ceded to Global Atlantic. Athene uses a present value of liability cash flows. Unobservable inputs include estimates of mortality, persistency, expenses, premium payments and a risk margin used in the discount rates that reflects the riskiness of the business. The universal life policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. Other liabilities Other liabilities includes funds withheld liability, as described above in funds withheld at interest embedded derivative, and a ceded modco agreement of certain inforce funding agreement contracts for which Athene elected the fair value option. Athene estimates the fair value of the ceded modco agreement by discounting projected cash flows for net settlements and certain periodic and non-periodic payments. Unobservable inputs include estimates for asset portfolio returns and economic inputs used in the discount rate, including risk margin. Depending on the projected cash flows and other assumptions, the contract may be recorded as an asset or liability. The estimate is classified as Level 3. 9.

Additionally, some agreements require placement of assets in trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding entity. The required minimum assets are equal to or greater than statutory reserves, as defined by the agreement, and were $ 21.6 billion and $ 12.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although Athene owns assets placed in trust, their use is restricted based on the trust agreement terms. If the statutory book value of the assets, or in certain cases fair value, in a trust declines because of impairments or other reasons, additional contributions of assets to the trust may be required. In addition, the assets within a trust may be subject to a pledge in favor of the applicable reinsurance company. 209 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reinsurance transactions Athene entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure a block of whole life policies during the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no block reinsurance transactions during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Global Atlantic Athene has a 100 % coinsurance and assumption agreement with Global Atlantic. The agreement ceded all existing open block life insurance business issued by Athene Annuity and Life Company (AAIA), with the exception of enhanced guarantee universal life insurance products. Athene also entered into a 100 % coinsurance agreement with Global Atlantic to cede all policy liabilities of the ILICO Closed Block. The ILICO Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Athene also has an excess of loss arrangement with Global Atlantic to be reimbursed for any payments required from Athenes general assets to meet the contractual obligations of the AmerUs Closed Block not covered by existing reinsurance through Athene Re USA IV. The AmerUs Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Since all liabilities were covered by the existing reinsurance at close, no reinsurance premiums were ceded. The assets backing the AmerUs Closed Block are managed, on AAIAs behalf, by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Global Atlantic maintained a series of trust and custody accounts under the terms of these agreements with assets equal to or greater than a required aggregate statutory balance of $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively. Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective) Athene reinsured substantially all of the existing life and health business of Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company (AADE) to Protective under a coinsurance agreement in 2011. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Protective maintained a trust for Athenes benefit with assets having a fair value of $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively.

Significant inputs and assumptions are required for determining the expected duration of the cohort and involves using accepted actuarial methods to determine decrement rates related to policyholder behavior for lapses, withdrawals (surrenders) and mortality. The assumptions used to determine the amortization of DAC and DSI are consistent with those used to estimate the related liability balance. Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method, which primarily includes funding agreements. The effective interest method requires inputs to project future cash flows, which for funding agreements includes contractual terms of notional value, periodic interest payments based on either fixed or floating interest rates, and duration. For other investment-type contracts which include immediate annuities and assumed endowments without significant mortality risks, assumptions are required related to policyholder behavior for lapses and withdrawals (surrenders).

For whole life products, significant assumptions and inputs include policyholder demographic data, assumptions for mortality, morbidity, and lapse and discount rates. 215 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if necessary. At least annually, Athene reviews all significant cash flow assumptions and updates as necessary, unless emerging experience indicates a more frequent review is necessary. The discount rate reflects market observable inputs from upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields and is interpolated, where necessary, to conform to the duration of Athenes liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $ 11,950 million, which was driven by $ 13,518 million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, $ 2,236 million change in discount rate assumptions related to a decrease in rates, and $ 1,664 million of interest accrual, partially offset by $ 3,852 million of benefit payments, $ 1,509 million reduction in reserve relating to recapture, and $ 297 million resulting from favorable unlocking of assumptions, primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $ 1,144 million, which was driven by $ 11,528 million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, and $ 1,146 million of interest accrual, partially offset by a $ 8,425 million change in discount rate assumptions related to an increase in rates and $ 2,921 million of benefit payments.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, net market risk benefit liabilities decreased by $ 1,958 million, which was primarily driven by a decrease of $ 2,169 million related to changes in the risk-free discount rate across the curve and a $ 366 million change in instrument-specific credit risk related to widening of credit spreads, partially offset by $ 333 million of fees collected from policyholders and $ 176 million of changes related to equity market performance. The determination of the fair value of market risk benefits requires the use of inputs related to fees and assessments and assumptions in determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance. Judgment is required for both economic and actuarial assumptions, which can be either observable or unobservable, that impact future policyholder account growth. Economic assumptions include interest rates and implied volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For indexed annuities, assumptions also include projected equity returns which impact cash flows attributable to indexed strategies, implied equity volatilities, expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. Assumptions related to the level of option budgets used for determining the future equity option costs and the impact on future policyholder account value growth are considered unobservable inputs. Policyholder behavior assumptions are unobservable inputs and are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate withdrawals (surrender rate) and income rider utilization. Assumptions are generally based on industry data and pricing assumptions which are updated for actual experience, if necessary. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products. All inputs are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. A risk margin is incorporated within the discount rate to reflect uncertainty in the projected cash flows such as variations in policyholder behavior, as well as a credit spread to reflect our nonperformance risk, which is considered an unobservable input. Athene uses the credit spread, relative to the U.S. Treasury curve based on its public credit rating as of the valuation date, as the credit spread to reflect its nonperformance risk in the estimate of the fair value of market risk benefits. 218 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

Profit sharing payable excludes the potential return of profit-sharing distributions that would be due if certain funds were liquidated, which is recorded in due from related parties in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company requires that a portion of certain of the performance revenues distributed to the Companys employees be used to purchase restricted shares of common stock issued under its Equity Plan.

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA). The IRA contains a number of tax-related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations (CAMT) as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. Based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made regarding the CAMT provisions of the IRA, which may change once further regulatory guidance is issued, the Company believes CAMT as well as the excise tax on stock repurchases will have an immaterial impact on our financial condition. AHL changed its domicile from Bermuda to the United States, causing AHL to become a U.S.-domiciled corporation and a U.S. taxpayer effective December 31, 2023 (the Redomicile) and will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax for 2024 and future years. AHLs Bermuda subsidiaries (and AHL for pre-Redomicile periods) file protective U.S. income tax returns. AHLs U.S. subsidiaries file, and AHL for post-Redomicile periods will file, income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state governments. On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax (Bermuda CIT). Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT generally will impose a 15% corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are resident in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment, without regard to any assurances that been given pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. The Company recorded material deferred tax assets as a result of the passage of the Bermuda CIT and recognized a material impact (decrease) to our consolidated effective rate upon recording the deferred tax assets. The U.K. enacted legislation in July 2023 implementing certain Pillar Two provisions that will apply to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. On November 29, 2023, a bill was introduced to U.K. Parliament which proposes certain amendments to the previously enacted Pillar Two legislation and which would include new Pillar Two provisions for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, as such legislative changes could result in changes to our effective tax rate. The primary jurisdictions in which the Company operates and incurs income taxes are the United States, United Kingdom, and beginning January 1, 2025 Bermuda.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company accrued interest of $ 10 million and $ 5 million, respectively. The Company has historically recorded deferred tax assets resulting from the step-up in the tax basis of assets, including intangibles, resulting from exchanges of AOG Units for Class A shares by the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners. A related liability has also historically been recorded in due to related parties in the consolidated statements of financial condition for the expected payments under the tax receivable agreement entered into by and among the Company, the Former Managing Partners, the Contributing Partners, and other parties thereto (as amended, the tax receivable agreement) (see note 19). The benefit the Company has historically obtained from the difference in the tax asset recognized and the related liability was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital. The amortization period for the portion of the increase in tax basis related to intangibles is 15 years. The realization of the remaining portion of the increase in tax basis relates to the disposition of the underlying assets to which the step-up is attributed. The associated deferred tax assets reverse at the time of the corresponding asset disposition. After the Mergers, the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners no longer own AOG Units. Therefore, there were no new exchanges subject to the tax receivable agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 15.

Equity-Based Compensation Under the Equity Plan, the Company grants equity-based awards to employees of AAM and AHL. Equity-based awards granted to employees and non-employees as compensation are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award, which considers the public share price of AGMs common stock subject to certain discounts, as applicable. The Company grants both service-based and performance-based awards. The estimated total grant date fair value for service-based awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally one to six years from the date of grant. Certain service-based awards are tied to profit sharing arrangements in which a portion of the performance fees distributed to the general partner are required to be used by employees to purchase restricted shares of common stock or is delivered in the form of RSUs, which are granted under the Companys Equity Plan. Performance-based awards vest subject to continued employment and the Companys achievement of specified performance goals. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, equity-based compensation expense for performance grants are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable. Equity-based awards that do not require future service ( i.e. , vested awards) are expensed immediately. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded equity-based compensation expense of $ 1.0 billion, $ 540 million and $ 1.2 billion respectively. Included in the December 31, 2023 equity-based compensation expense is $ 457 million related to special fully-vested grants, which are subject to deferred delivery and restrictive covenants (including non-competition and non-solicitation requirements). These awards were expensed immediately as they do not require future service. As of December 31, 2023, there was $ 668 million of estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period o f 2.4 years. 226 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

The Company has granted RSUs that provide the right to receive, subject to vesting during continued employment, shares of common stock pursuant to the Equity Plan. Any dividend equivalent paid to an employee on RSUs will not be returned to the Company upon forfeiture of the award by the employee. Vested and unvested RSUs that are entitled to non-forfeitable dividend equivalents qualify as participating securities and are included in the Companys basic and diluted earnings per share computations using the two-class method. The holder of an RSU participating security would have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the entity if the holder is obligated to fund the losses of the issuing entity or if the contractual principal or mandatory redemption amount of the participating security is reduced as a result of losses incurred by the issuing entity. The RSU participating securities do not have a mandatory redemption amount and the holders of the participating securities are not obligated to fund losses; therefore, neither the vested RSUs nor the unvested RSUs are subject to any contractual obligation to share in losses of the Company. Prior to December 31, 2021, AAM had one Class B share outstanding, which was held by BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. (BRH). The voting power of the Class B share was reduced on a one vote per one AOG Unit basis in the event of an exchange of AOG Units for Class A shares, subject to the terms of AAMs certificate of incorporation. The Class B share had no net income (loss) per share as it did not participate in Apollos earnings (losses) or dividends. The Class B share had no dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation right. The Class B share represented 0.0 % of the total voting power of the Class A shares and Class B share with respect to the limited matters upon which they were entitled to vote together as a single class pursuant to AAMs 233 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS governing documents as of December 31, 2021. On December 31, 2021, the Class B share was exchanged for 10 Class A shares, which were subsequently exchanged into 10 shares of AGM common stock in the Mergers on January 1, 2022.

Related Parties Asset Management Due from/ to related parties Due from/ to related parties includes:  unpaid management fees, transaction and advisory fees and reimbursable expenses from the funds Apollo manages and their portfolio companies;  reimbursable payments for certain operating costs incurred by these funds as well as their related parties; and  other related party amounts arising from transactions, including loans to employees and periodic sales of ownership interests in funds managed by Apollo. Due from related parties and Due to related parties consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: (In millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Due from Related Parties: Due from funds 1 $ 299 $ 269 Due from portfolio companies 40 106 Due from employees and former employees 110 90 Total Due from Related Parties $ 449 $ 465 Due to Related Parties: Due to Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners 2 $ 661 $ 874 Due to funds 209 124 Total Due to Related Parties $ 870 $ 998 1 Includes $ 37 million and $ 43 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, related to a receivable from a fund in connection with the Companys sale of a platform investment to such fund. The amount is payable to the Company over five years and is held at fair value. 2 Includes $ 175 million and $ 351 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, related to the AOG Unit Payment, payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2024. Tax Receivable Agreement Prior to the consummation of the Mergers, each of the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners had the right to exchange vested AOG Units for Class A shares, subject to certain restrictions. All Apollo Operating Group entities have made, or will make, an election under Section 754 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which will result in an adjustment to the tax basis of the assets owned by the Apollo Operating Group entities at the time an exchange was made. The election results in an increase to the tax basis of underlying assets which will reduce the amount of gain and associated tax that AGM and its subsidiaries will otherwise be required to pay in the future. 234 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The tax receivable agreement (TRA) provides for payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85 % of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes the Company realizes as a result of the increases in tax basis of assets resulting from transactions and other exchanges of AOG Units for Class A shares that have occurred in prior years. AGM and its subsidiaries retain the benefit from the remaining 15 % of actual cash tax savings. If the Company does not make the required annual payment on a timely basis as outlined in the tax receivable agreement, interest is accrued on the balance until the payment date. Following the closing of the Mergers, as the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners no longer own AOG Units, there were no new exchanges subject to the TRA. AOG Unit Payment On December 31, 2021, holders of AOG Units (other than Athene and the Company) sold and transferred a portion of such AOG Units to a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for an amount equal to $ 3.66 multiplied by the total number of AOG Units held by such holders immediately prior to such transaction. The remainder of the AOG Units held by such holders were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers on January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding payable amount due to Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners was $ 175 million, which is payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2024. Due from Employees and Former Employees As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, due from related parties includes various amounts due to Apollo, including employee loans and return of profit-sharing distributions. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the balance includes interest-bearing employee loans receivable of $ 3 million and $ 9 million, respectively. The outstanding principal amount of the loans as well as all accrued and unpaid interest is required to be repaid at the earlier of the eighth anniversary of the date of the relevant loan or at the date of the relevant employees resignation. The receivable from certain employees and former employees includes an amount for the potential return of profit-sharing distributions that would be due if certain funds were liquidated of $ 99 million and $ 72 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Indemnity Certain of the performance revenues Apollo earns from funds may be subject to repayment by its subsidiaries that are general partners of the funds in the event that certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain other investment professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligations of these subsidiaries in respect of this obligation. Such guarantees are several and not joint and are limited to a particular individuals distributions. Apollo has agreed to indemnify each of the Former Managing Partners and certain Contributing Partners against all amounts that they pay pursuant to any of these personal guarantees in favor of certain funds that it manages (including costs and expenses related to investigating the basis for or objecting to any claims made in respect of the guarantees) for all interests that the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners contributed or sold to the Apollo Operating Group. Apollo recorded an indemnification liability of $ 0.3 million and $ 13 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Due to Related Parties Based upon an assumed liquidation of certain of the funds Apollo manages, it has recorded a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations, which represents amounts due to certain funds. The obligation is recognized based upon an assumed liquidation of a funds net assets as of the reporting date. The actual determination and any required payment would not take place until the final disposition of a funds investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund. 235 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Apollo recorded general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance allocations related to certain funds of $ 174 million and $ 107 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Athora Apollo, through ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and Athora, a strategic liabilities platform that acquires or reinsures blocks of insurance business in the German and broader European life insurance market (collectively, the Athora Accounts). AAM and its subsidiaries had equity commitments outstanding to Athora of up to $ 353 million as of December 31, 2023, subject to certain conditions. Athora Sub-Advised Apollo provides sub-advisory services with respect to a portion of the assets in certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and the Athora Accounts. Apollo broadly refers to Athora Sub-Advised assets as those assets in the Athora Accounts which Apollo explicitly sub-advises as well as those assets in the Athora Accounts which are invested directly in funds and investment vehicles Apollo manages.

The Aviation Loans are generally fully secured by aircraft leases and aircraft and are securitized by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for which Apollo acts as ABS manager (ABS-SPV). The ABS-SPV issues tranches of senior notes and subordinated notes, which are secured by the Aviation Loans. Athene purchased both senior and subordinated notes of PK Air. During the first quarter of 2022, Athene contributed its investment in the subordinated notes to PK Air Holdings, LP, and then contributed PK Air Holdings, LP to AAA during the second quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Athene held $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, of PK Air senior notes, which are included in investment in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene has commitments to make additional investments in PK Air of $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. Venerable VA Capital Company LLC (VA Capital) is owned by a consortium of investors, led by affiliates of Apollo, Crestview Partners III Management, LLC and Reverence Capital Partners L.P., and is the parent of Venerable, which is the parent of VIAC. VIAC is a related party due to Athenes minority equity investment in its holding companys parent, VA Capital, which was $ 181 million and $ 240 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The minority equity investment in VA Capital is included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition and accounted for as an equity method investment. Athene has coinsurance and modco agreements with VIAC. Effective July 1, 2023, VIAC recaptured $ 2.7 billion of reserves, which represents a portion of their business that was subject to those coinsurance and modco agreements. Athene recognized a gain of $ 555 million, which is included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the settlement of the recapture agreement. As a result of Athenes intent to transfer the assets supporting this business to VIAC in connection with the recapture, Athene was required by US GAAP to recognize the unrealized losses on these assets of $ 104 million as intent-to-sell impairments in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, Athene has term loans receivable from Venerable due in 2033, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The loans are held at fair value and were $ 343 million and $ 303 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. While management views the overall transactions with Venerable as favorable to Athene, the stated interest rate of 6.257 % on the term loans to Venerable represented a below-market interest rate, and management considered such rate as part of its evaluation and pricing of the reinsurance transactions. Wheels Athene contributed its limited partnership investment in Athene Freedom Parent, LP (Athene Freedom), for which Apollo is the general partner, to AAA during the second quarter of 2022. Athene Freedom indirectly invests in Wheels, Inc. (Wheels). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Athene owned $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, of AFS securities issued by Wheels, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene also has commitments to make additional investments in Wheels of $ 83 million as of December 31, 2023. Apollo/Athene Dedicated Investment Programs Athenes subsidiary, ACRA 1 is partially owned by ADIP I, a series of funds managed by Apollo. Athenes subsidiary, ALRe, currently holds 36.55 % of the economic interests in ACRA 1 and all of ACRA 1s voting interests, with ADIP I holding the remaining 63.45 % of the economic interests. Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50 % of its non-voting, economic interests in ACRA 2 to ADIP II, a fund managed by Apollo, for $ 640 million. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP IIs ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60 %, with ALRe owning the remaining 40 % of economic interests. ALRe holds all of ACRA 2s voting interests. 239 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Athene received capital contributions and paid distributions relating to ACRA of the following: Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 Contributions from ADIP $ 996 $ 1,047 Distributions to ADIP ( 539 ) ( 63 ) 20. Commitments and Contingencies Investment Commitments The Company has unfunded capital commitments of $ 627 million as of December 31, 2023 related to the funds it manages. Separately, Athene had commitments to make investments, primarily capital contributions to investment funds, inclusive of related party commitments discussed previously, of $ 21.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects most of the current commitments will be invested over the next five years; however, these commitments could become due any time upon counterparty request. Contingent Obligations Performance allocations with respect to certain funds are subject to reversal in the event of future losses to the extent of the cumulative revenues recognized in income to date. If all of the existing investments became worthless, the amount of cumulative revenues that have been recognized by Apollo through December 31, 2023 and that could be reversed approximates $ 5.0 billion. Performance allocations are affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that Apollo manages. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. Movements in these items can affect valuations quarter to quarter even if the underlying business fundamentals remain stable. Management views the possibility of all of the investments becoming worthless as remote. Additionally, at the end of the life of certain funds, Apollo may be obligated as general partner, to repay the funds performance allocations received in excess of what was ultimately earned. This obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of each fund or as otherwise set forth in the partnership agreement of the fund. Certain funds may not generate performance allocations as a result of unrealized and realized losses that are recognized in the current and prior reporting periods. In certain cases, performance allocations will not be generated until additional unrealized and realized gains occur. Any appreciation would first cover the deductions for invested capital, unreturned organizational expenses, operating expenses, management fees and priority returns based on the terms of the respective fund agreements. One of Apollos subsidiaries, AGS, provides underwriting commitments in connection with securities offerings of related parties of Apollo, including portfolio companies of the funds Apollo manages, as well as third parties. As of December 31, 2023, there were no open underwriting commitments. The Company, along with a third-party institutional investor, has committed to provide financing to a consolidated VIE that invests across Apollos capital markets platform (such VIE, the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership). Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company has committed equity financing to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership. The Apollo Capital Markets Partnership also has a revolving credit facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as lead arranger, administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, Mizuho Bank Ltd., and other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which it may borrow up to $ 2.25 billion. The revolving credit facility, which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2025, is non-recourse to the Company, except that the Company provided customary comfort letters with respect to its capital contributions to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership. As of December 31, 2023, the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership had funded commitments of $ 955 million, on a net basis, to transactions across Apollos capital markets platform, all of which were funded through the revolving credit facility and other asset-based financing. No capital had been funded by the Company to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership pursuant to its commitment. Whether the commitments of the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. It is expected that between the time the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership makes a commitment and funding of such commitment, 240 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS efforts will be made to syndicate such commitment to, among others, third parties, which should reduce its risk when committing to certain transactions. The Apollo Capital Markets Partnership may also, with respect to a particular transaction, enter into other arrangements with third parties which reduce its commitment risk. In connection with the acquisition of Stone Tower in 2012, Apollo agreed to pay its former owners a specified percentage of future performance revenues earned from certain of its funds, CLOs, and strategic investment accounts. This obligation was determined based on the present value of estimated future performance revenue payments and is recorded in other liabilities. The fair value of the remaining contingent obligation was $ 67 million and $ 55 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This contingent consideration obligation is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the obligations are satisfied. The changes in the fair value of the Stone Tower contingent consideration obligation is reflected in profit sharing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the acquisition of Griffin Capitals U.S. asset management business on May 3, 2022, Apollo agreed to pay its former owners certain share-based consideration contingent on specified AUM and capital raising thresholds. This obligation was determined based on the present value of estimated future performance relative to such thresholds and is recorded in other liabilities. The fair value of the remaining contingent obligation was $ 26 million and $ 31 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This contingent consideration obligation is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the respective thresholds are met such that the contingencies are satisfied. The changes in the fair value of the Griffin Capital contingent consideration obligation are reflected in other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Funding Agreements Athene is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB) and, through its membership, has issued funding agreements to the FHLB in exchange for cash advances. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene had $ 6.5 billion and $ 3.7 billion, respectively, of FHLB funding agreements outstanding. Athene is required to provide collateral in excess of the funding agreement amounts outstanding, considering any discounts to the securities posted and prepayment penalties. Athene has a funding agreement backed notes (FABN) program, which allows Athene Global Funding, a special purpose, unaffiliated statutory trust, to offer its senior secured medium-term notes. Athene Global Funding uses the net proceeds from each sale to purchase one or more funding agreements from Athene. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene had $ 19.9 billion and $ 21.0 billion, respectively, of FABN funding agreements outstanding. Athene had $ 14.8 billion of board-authorized FABN capacity remaining as of December 31, 2023. Athene established a secured funding agreement backed repurchase agreement (FABR) program, in which a special-purpose, unaffiliated entity enters into repurchase agreements with a bank and the proceeds of the repurchase agreements are used by the special purpose entity to purchase funding agreements from Athene. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene had $ 6.0 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively, of FABR funding agreements outstanding. Pledged Assets and Funds in Trust (Restricted Assets) Athenes total restricted assets included on the consolidated statements of financial condition are as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 AFS securities $ 32,458 $ 15,366 Trading securities 139 55 Equity securities 80 38 Mortgage loans 14,257 8,849 Investment funds 409 103 Derivative assets 73 65 Short-term investments 153 120 Other investments 313 170 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 1,761 628 Total restricted assets $ 49,643 $ 25,394 241 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The restricted assets are primarily related to reinsurance trusts established in accordance with coinsurance agreements and the FHLB and FABR funding agreements described above. Letters of Credit Athene has undrawn letters of credit totaling $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. These letters of credit were issued for Athenes reinsurance program and have expirations through June 19, 2026. Atlas In connection with the Company and CSs previously announced transaction, whereby Atlas acquired certain assets of the CS Securitized Products Group, two subsidiaries of the Company have each issued an assurance letter to CS to guarantee the full five year deferred purchase obligation of Atlas in the amount of $ 3.3 billion. The fair value of the liability related to the Companys guarantee is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Litigation and Regulatory Matters The Company is party to various legal actions arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including claims and lawsuits, arbitrations, reviews, investigations or proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business. On December 21, 2017, several entities referred to collectively as Harbinger commenced an action in New York Supreme Court captioned Harbinger Capital Partners II LP et al. v. Apollo Global Management LLC, et al. (No. 657515/2017). The complaint named as defendants AAM, and funds managed by Apollo that invested in SkyTerra Communications, Inc. (SkyTerra), among others. The complaint alleged that during the period of Harbingers various equity and debt investments in SkyTerra from 2004 to 2010, the defendants concealed from Harbinger material defects in SkyTerra technology. The complaint further alleged that Harbinger would not have made investments in SkyTerra totaling approximately $ 1.9 billion had it known of the defects, and that the public disclosure of these defects ultimately led to SkyTerra filing for bankruptcy in 2012 (after it had been renamed LightSquared). The complaint sought $ 1.9 billion in damages, as well as punitive damages, interest, costs, and fees. On June 12, 2019, Harbinger voluntarily discontinued the state action without prejudice. On June 8, 2020, Harbinger refiled its litigation in New York Supreme Court, captioned Harbinger Capital Partners II, LP et al. v. Apollo Global Management, LLC et al. (No. 652342/2020). The complaint adds eight new defendants and three new claims relating to Harbingers contention that the new defendants induced Harbinger to buy CCTV One Four Holdings, LLC (CCTV) to support SkyTerras network even though they allegedly knew that the network had material defects. On November 23, 2020, Defendants refiled a bankruptcy motion, and on November 24, 2020, filed in the state court a motion to stay the state court proceedings pending a ruling by the bankruptcy court on the bankruptcy motion. On February 1, 2021, the bankruptcy court denied the bankruptcy motion. Defendants filed their motions to dismiss the New York Supreme Court action on March 31, 2021, which were granted in part and denied in part on May 23, 2023. The court granted in full the Defendants motion to dismiss Harbingers complaint as time-barred and denied as moot the Defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs have appealed the courts decision. Apollo believes the claims in this action are without merit. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. In March 2020, Frank Funds, which claims to be a former shareholder of MPM Holdings, Inc. (MPM), commenced an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Frank Funds v. Apollo Global Management, Inc., et al. , C.A. No. 2020-0130, against AAM, certain former MPM directors (including three Apollo officers and employees), and members of the consortium that acquired MPM in a May 2019 merger. The complaint asserted, on behalf of a putative class of former MPM shareholders, a claim against Apollo for breach of its fiduciary duties as MPMs alleged controlling shareholder in connection with the May 2019 merger. Frank Funds seeks unspecified compensatory damages. On July 23, 2019, a group of former MPM shareholders filed an appraisal petition in Delaware Chancery Court seeking the fair value of their MPM shares that were purchased through MPMs May 15, 2019 merger, in an action captioned In re Appraisal of MPM Holdings, Inc. , C.A. No. 2019-0519 (Del. Ch.). On June 3, 2020, petitioners moved for leave to file a verified amended appraisal petition and class-action complaint that included claims for breach of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty against AAM, the Apollo-affiliated fund that owned MPMs shares before the merger, certain former MPM directors (including three Apollo employees), and members of the consortium that acquired MPM, based on alleged actions related to the May 2019 merger. The petitioners also sought to consolidate their appraisal proceeding with the Frank Funds action. On November 13, 2020, the Chancery Court granted the parties stipulated order to consolidate the two matters, and on December 21, 2020, the Chancery Court granted petitioners motion for leave to file the proposed amended complaint. This new consolidated action is captioned In Re MPM 242 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Holdings Inc. Appraisal and Stockholder Litigation , C.A. No. 2019-0519 (Del Ch.). On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants filed a stipulation of settlement with the Chancery Court. On February 23, 2024, the Chancery Court held a hearing on the proposed settlement, which is now pending Court approval. On August 4, 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against PlayAGS Inc. (PlayAGS), all of the members of PlayAGSs board of directors (including three directors who are affiliated with Apollo), certain underwriters of PlayAGS (including Apollo Global Securities, LLC), as well as AAM, Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., Apollo Gaming Holdings, L.P., and Apollo Gaming Voteco, LLC (these last four parties, together, the Apollo Defendants). The complaint asserted claims against all defendants arising under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain secondary offerings of PlayAGS stock conducted in August 2018 and March 2019, alleging that the registration statements issued in connection with those offerings did not fully disclose certain business challenges facing PlayAGS. The complaint further asserted a control person claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Apollo Defendants and the director defendants (including the directors affiliated with Apollo), alleging such defendants were responsible for certain misstatements and omissions by PlayAGS about its business. On December 2, 2022, the Court dismissed all claims against the underwriters (including Apollo Global Securities, LLC) and the Apollo Defendants, but allowed a claim against PlayAGS and two of PlayAGSs executives to proceed. On February 13, 2024, the Court dismissed the entire case against all defendants, with prejudice, and instructed the clerk of the court to close the case. On August 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of AGM filed a shareholder derivative complaint (the Original Complaint) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against current AGM directors Marc Rowan, Scott Kleinman, James Zelter, Alvin Krongard, Michael Ducey, and Pauline Richards, Apollo Former Managing Partners Leon Black and Joshua Harris, and, as a nominal defendant, AGM. The action is captioned Anguilla Social Security Board vs. Black et al., C.A. No. 2023-0846-JTL and challenges the $ 570 million payments being made to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners in connection with the elimination of the Up-C structure that was in place prior to Apollos merger with Athene. As previously disclosed in Apollos SEC filings, this purported stockholder previously had sought and received documents relating to the transaction pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Original Complaint alleged that the challenged payments amount to corporate waste, that the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners received payments in connection with the Corporate Recapitalization that exceed fair value and therefore breached their fiduciary duties, and that the independent conflicts committee of the AAM board of directors (which then consisted of Mr. Krongard, Mr. Ducey, and Ms. Richards) that negotiated the elimination of the TRA breached their fiduciary duties. The Original Complaint alleged that pre-suit demand was futile because a majority of AGMs board is either not independent from the Former Managing Partners or face a substantial likelihood of liability in light of the challenges to the transaction. The Original Complaint sought, among other things, declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest, restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys fees. On November 16, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the Original Complaint on the basis that, among other things, the plaintiff failed to make a pre-suit demand on the Apollo board of directors. On February 9, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the Amended Complaint) that adds new factual allegations but names the same defendants, asserts the same causes of action, and seeks the same relief as the Original Complaint. The Amended Complaint alleges that pre-suit demand was futile for the same reasons alleged in the Original Complaint. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. Certain of Apollos investment adviser subsidiaries have received a request for information and documents from the SEC in connection with an investigation concerning compliance with record retention requirements relating to business communications sent or received via electronic messaging channels. As has been publicly reported, the SEC is conducting similar investigations of other investment advisers. 21. Statutory Requirements Athenes insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including Bermuda and the U.S. Certain regulations include restrictions that limit the dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to stockholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between financial statements prepared for insurance regulatory authorities and U.S. GAAP financial statements vary by jurisdiction. 243 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Bermuda statutory requirements ALRe, AARe, Athene Co-Invest Reinsurance Affiliate 1A Ltd. (ACRA 1A) and Athene Co-Invested Reinsurance Affiliate 2A Ltd. (ACRA 2A) are each licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA) as long-term insurers and are subject to the Insurance Act 1978, as amended (the Bermuda Insurance Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The BMA implemented the Economic Balance Sheet (the EBS) framework into the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR), which was granted equivalence to the European Unions Directive (2009/138/EC) (Solvency II). Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, long-term insurers are required to maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus to meet the minimum margin of solvency (MMS) and minimum economic statutory capital and surplus (EBS capital and surplus) to meet the Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR). For Athenes Class C reinsurers, ACRA 1A and ACRA 2A, MMS is equal to the greater of $ 500,000 , 1.5 % of the total statutory assets or 25 % of ECR. For Athenes Class E reinsurers, ALRe and AARe, MMS is equal to the greater of $ 8 million, 2 % of the first $ 500 million of statutory assets plus 1.5 % of statutory assets above $ 500 million or 25 % of ECR. For each class, the ECR is calculated based on a risk-based capital model where risk factor charges are applied to the EBS. The ECR is floored at the MMS. As of December 31, 2023, Athenes Bermuda subsidiaries were in excess of the minimum levels required. For Athenes Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, the ECR is the binding regulatory constraint. The following represents the EBS capital and surplus and BSCR ratios: December 31, 2023 1 December 31, 2022 (In millions, except percentages) EBS capital & surplus BSCR ratio EBS capital & surplus BSCR ratio ALRe $ 18,245 233 % $ 16,759 256 % AARe 26,647 291 % 21,876 278 % ACRA 1A 5,296 219 % 5,993 262 % ACRA 2A 3,717 353 % 198 N/A 1 Amounts reported reflect Athenes best estimates as of the date these financial statements were issued and exclude the impact of any deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the enactment of the Bermuda CIT. Under the Bermuda statutory framework, statutory financial statements are generally equivalent to U.S. GAAP financial statements, with the exception of prudential filters and permitted practices granted by the BMA. Athenes Bermuda subsidiaries have permission in the statutory financial statements to use amortized cost instead of fair value as the basis for certain investments. Additionally, Athenes Bermuda subsidiaries use U.S. statutory reserving principles for the calculation of insurance reserves instead of U.S. GAAP, subject to the reserves being proved adequate based on cash flow testing. The following represents the effect of the permitted practices to the statutory financial statements: December 31, 2023 (In millions) ALRe AARe ACRA 1A ACRA 2A Increase (decrease) to capital and surplus due to permitted practices $ 3,031 $ 8,619 $ 4,105 $ ( 938 ) Increase (decrease) to statutory net income due to permitted practices ( 1,593 ) ( 8,278 ) ( 1,471 ) ( 930 ) Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, Athenes Bermuda subsidiaries are prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior years statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the companies respective board of directors and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA, and further subject to meeting the MMS and ECR requirements, a Bermuda subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA. The following represents the maximum distribution Athenes Bermuda subsidiaries would be permitted to remit to its parent without the need for prior approval: 244 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

The regulatory authority recognizes only statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the corresponding state for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company and for determining its solvency under insurance law. The maximum dividend these subsidiaries can pay to stockholders, without prior approval of the respective state insurance department, is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus or net gain from operations. The maximum dividend payment over a twelve-month period may not, without prior approval, be paid from a source other than earned surplus and may not exceed the greater of (1) the prior years net gain from operations or (2) 10% of policyholders surplus. Based on these restrictions, the maximum dividend AADE could pay to its parent absent regulatory approval was $ 0 million as of each of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Any dividends from AHLs other U.S. statutory entities in excess of the amounts allowed for AADE would not be able to be remitted to its parent without regulatory approval from the Delaware Department of Insurance. As of December 31, 2023, Athenes U.S. subsidiaries solvency, liquidity and risk-based capital amounts were significantly in excess of the minimum levels required. In some instances, the states of domicile of U.S. subsidiaries have adopted prescribed accounting practices that differ from the required accounting outlined in NAIC Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP). These subsidiaries also have certain accounting practices permitted by the states of domicile that differ from those found in NAIC SAP. These prescribed and permitted practices are described as follows: AAIA Among the products issued by AAIA are indexed universal life insurance and fixed indexed annuities. These products allow a portion of the premium to earn interest based on certain indices, primarily the S&P 500. Athene purchases call options, futures and variance swaps to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related index. The Iowa Insurance Division allows an insurer to elect (1) to use an amortized cost method to account for certain derivative instruments, such as call options, purchased to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer on indexed insurance products and (2) to use an indexed annuity reserve calculation methodology under which call options associated with the current index interest crediting term are valued at zero. AAIA has elected to apply this option to its over-the-counter call options and reserve liabilities. As a result, AAIAs statutory surplus decreased by $ 28 million and increased by $ 62 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Athene Re USA IV AAIA has ceded the AmerUs Closed Block to Athene Re USA IV on a 100% funds withheld basis. A permitted practice in the State of Vermont allows Athene Re USA IV to include as admitted assets the face amount of all issued and outstanding letters of credit used to fund its reinsurance obligations to AAIA in its statutory financial statements. If Athene Re USA IV had not 245 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS followed this permitted practice, then it would not have exceeded authorized control level risk-based capital requirements. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Athene Re USA IV included as admitted assets $ 96 million and $ 112 million, respectively, related to the outstanding letters of credit. Statutory capital and surplus and net income (loss) The following table presents, for each of Athenes primary insurance subsidiaries, the statutory capital and surplus and the statutory net income (loss), based on the most recent statutory financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators: Statutory capital & surplus Statutory net income (loss) (In millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Year ended December 31, 2023 Year ended December 31, 2022 ALRe $ 14,474 $ 13,084 $ 832 $ 937 AARe 17,773 17,126 408 1,329 ACRA 1A 5,092 5,637 297 ( 87 ) ACRA 2A 1,952 198 ( 759 ) ( 2 ) AADE 3,144 2,298  ( 20 ) AAIA 2,876 2,067 ( 209 ) ( 238 ) AANY 290 284 ( 3 ) ( 23 ) 22. Segments The Company conducts its business through three reportable segments: (i) Asset Management, (ii) Retirement Services and (iii) Principal Investing. Segment information is utilized by the Companys chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources. The performance is measured by the Companys chief operating decision maker on an unconsolidated basis because the chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of the Companys business segments based on financial and operating metrics and data that exclude the effects of consolidation of any of the affiliated funds. Segment Income Segment Income is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the asset management, retirement services, and principal investing segments. Management uses Segment Income to make key operating decisions such as the following:  decisions related to the allocation of resources such as staffing decisions, including hiring and locations for deployment of the new hires;  decisions related to capital deployment such as providing capital to facilitate growth for the business and/or to facilitate expansion into new businesses;  decisions related to expenses, such as determining annual discretionary bonuses and equity-based compensation awards to its employees. With respect to compensation, management seeks to align the interests of certain professionals and selected other individuals with those of the investors in the funds and those of Apollos stockholders by providing such individuals a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in relation to the funds. To achieve that objective, a certain amount of compensation is based on Apollos performance and growth for the year; and  decisions related to the amount of earnings available for dividends to common stockholders and holders of equity-based awards that participate in dividends. Segment Income is a measure of profitability and has certain limitations in that it does not take into account certain items included under U.S. GAAP. Segment Income is the sum of (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Spread Related Earnings and (iii) Principal Investing Income. Segment Income excludes the effects of the consolidation of any of the related funds and SPACs, interest and other financing costs related to AGM not attributable to any specific segment, taxes and related payables, transaction-related charges and any acquisitions. Transaction-related charges includes equity-based compensation charges, the amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration, and certain other charges associated with acquisitions, and 246 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS restructuring charges. In addition, Segment Income excludes non-cash revenue and expense related to equity awards granted by unconsolidated related parties to employees of the Company, compensation and administrative related expense reimbursements, as well as the assets, liabilities and operating results of the funds and VIEs that are included in the consolidated financial statements. Segment Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use Segment Income as a measure of operating performance, not as a measure of liquidity. Segment Income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of Segment Income without consideration of related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above. Management compensates for these limitations by using Segment Income as a supplemental measure to U.S. GAAP results, to provide a more complete understanding of our performance as management measures it. A reconciliation of Segment Income to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure of income (loss) before income tax provision can be found in this footnote. Fee Related Earnings Fee Related Earnings (FRE) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. FRE is the sum of (i) management fees, (ii) capital solutions and other related fees, (iii) fee-related performance fees from indefinite term vehicles, that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not dependent on realization events of the underlying investments, excluding performance fees from Athene and performance fees from origination platforms dependent on capital appreciation, and (iv) other income, net, less (a) fee-related compensation, excluding equity-based compensation, (b) non-compensation expenses incurred in the normal course of business, (c) placement fees and (d) non-controlling interests in the management companies of certain funds the Company manages. Spread Related Earnings Spread Related Earnings (SRE) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility, which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets, and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses. For the Retirement Services segment, SRE equals the sum of (i) the net investment earnings on Athenes net invested assets and (ii) management fees received on business managed for others, primarily the ADIP portion of Athenes business ceded to ACRA, less (x) cost of funds, (y) operating expenses excluding equity-based compensation and (z) financing costs, including interest expense and preferred dividends, if any, paid to Athene preferred stockholders. Principal Investing Income Principal Investing Income (PII) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. For the Principal Investing segment, PII is the sum of (i) realized performance fees, including certain realizations received in the form of equity, and (ii) realized investment income, less (x) realized principal investing compensation expense, excluding expense related to equity-based compensation, and (y) certain corporate compensation and non-compensation expenses. 247 Table of Contents APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

D PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Apollo is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Apollos internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Apollos internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Apollos assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Apollos internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that Apollos internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was effective. 256 Table of Contents Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Apollos financial statements included in this report and issued its report on the effectiveness of Apollos internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included herein.
