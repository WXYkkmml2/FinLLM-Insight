=== ITEM 1. BUSINESS ===

 1. BUSINESS The Company With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,500 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as one reportable segment, referred to as the Regulated Businesses. The Company also operates other businesses that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities. Individually, these other businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within Other, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, our, the Company, and American Water mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to parent company mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. Regulated Businesses The Companys primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Companys utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states in the United States, with 3.5 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Companys utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (PUCs). Federal, state and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,920 million for 2023, $3,505 million for 2022 and $3,384 million for 2021, accounting for 93%, 92% and 86%, respectively, of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods. Presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves, by type of service, for and as of the year ended December 31, 2023: Operating Revenues (in millions) Number of Customers (in thousands) Water (a) Wastewater Total % of Total Water Wastewater Total % of Total Pennsylvania $ 810 $ 155 $ 965 24.6 % 683 98 781 22.4 % New Jersey 908 57 965 24.6 % 668 64 732 21.0 % Missouri 430 20 450 11.5 % 483 24 507 14.5 % Illinois 366 61 427 10.9 % 299 72 371 10.6 % California 300 4 304 7.8 % 190 3 193 5.5 % TotalTop Five States (b) 2,814 297 3,111 79.4 % 2,323 261 2,584 74.1 % Other (c) 779 30 809 20.6 % 865 37 902 25.9 % Total Regulated Businesses $ 3,593 $ 327 $ 3,920 100.0 % 3,188 298 3,486 100.0 % (a) Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents. (b) The Companys Top Five States are determined based upon operating revenues. (c) Includes the Companys utility operations in the following states: Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia and other revenue attributable collectively to the Regulated Businesses. Customers The Companys Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other entity that purchases the Companys water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the Companys services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities. 4 Table of Contents The vast majority of the Companys regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers water usage, typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Companys wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption. Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Companys customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i) commercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers. Presented in the table below is a breakout of the Companys Regulated Businesses operating revenue by class of customer, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021: 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Revenue Percentage of Revenue Revenue Percentage of Revenue Revenue Percentage of Revenue Water services: Residential $ 2,143 55 % $ 1,941 55 % $ 1,935 57 % Commercial 798 20 % 710 20 % 676 20 % Fire service 158 4 % 147 4 % 151 5 % Industrial 167 4 % 153 4 % 141 4 % Public and other water (a) 284 7 % 267 8 % 239 7 % Wastewater 327 8 % 242 7 % 208 6 % Other (b) 43 2 % 45 2 % 34 1 % Total $ 3,920 100 % $ 3,505 100 % $ 3,384 100 % (a) Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities, community water systems under bulk contracts and alternative revenue programs. (b) Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents. Presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the Companys Regulated Businesses served by class of customer as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, which represents approximately 14 million people served as of December 31, 2023: 2023 2022 2021 (In thousands) Water Wastewater Water Wastewater Water Wastewater Residential 2,893 279 2,870 270 2,972 245 Commercial 221 18 219 17 225 15 Fire service 4  51  52  Industrial 52  4  4  Public and other (a) 18 1 17 1 16 1 Total (b) 3,188 298 3,161 288 3,269 261 (a) Includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts. Bulk contracts, which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above, generally result in service to multiple customers. (b) The Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary on January 1, 2022 and the sale of its Michigan subsidiary on February 4, 2022. Customer growth in the Companys Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems. 5 Table of Contents Capital Investment The Company plans to invest between $34 billion and $38 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its Regulated Businesses water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an approximate 125-year replacement cycle by 2028, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2024 and 2028. In addition, from 2024 to 2028, the Companys capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further seeking to address infrastructure renewal, resiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. The Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. Regulation and Rate Making The operations of the Companys Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital. Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utilitys need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize regulatory lag, which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utilitys revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change. The Companys Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices: Regulatory Practices Description States Allowed Infrastructure replacement surcharge mechanisms Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe and reliable services for the Companys customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency. IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA, WV Future test year A test year is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be effective. The use of a future test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis. CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, PA, TN, VA Hybrid test year A historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year allows an update to historical data for known and measurable changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. MD, MO, NJ, WV Utility plant recovery mechanisms Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects. CA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VA Expense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utilitys control, to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding. CA, HI, IL, IN, MD, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA Revenue stability mechanisms Adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility recovers the revenues authorized in its general rate case, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. CA, IL Consolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state, and is generally used to moderate the price impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania and West Virginia also permit a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements. CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, PA, VA, WV Deferred accounting A regulators willingness to defer recognition of financial impacts when setting rates for utilities. All The Company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Companys proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Companys strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist. 6 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Strategic Growth The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions. According to the most recent study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the countrys wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates, as of 2017, that there are over 50,000 community water systems and over 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less. A fundamental aspect of the Companys growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Companys regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the Companys existing management (although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all, of the employees of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Companys current customer mix of 91% water and 9% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The Company will also evaluate whether there is a line of sight to grow to sufficient scale in a new regulated market so that it can attain efficiencies and promote customer affordability after entering a new domestic market. Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, cybersecurity and water quality and water accountability regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements, among others, that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets. Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc. On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (Liberty), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Companys New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The Companys regulated New York operations represented approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. Industry Legislation In 2020 and 2021, the United States Congress passed, and the President signed into law, legislation with water and wastewater provisions including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJA), the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan of 2021. The legislation provided funding for a variety of initiatives to support water and wastewater infrastructure, lead service line replacement, treatment of PFAS and other contaminants of emerging concern, and low-income water assistance (LIHWAP). LIHWAP expired in 2023. The Companys regulated subsidiaries in New Jersey, Indiana, and Missouri have versions of water quality or safety accountability acts which require operational or safety and security standards for water and wastewater utilities serving a certain number of customers. In New Jersey, the law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, hydrant and valve maintenance and cybersecurity. In Indiana, the law requires water and wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses, develop capital asset management plans and conduct cybersecurity and water loss audits. In Missouri, the act requires water and wastewater utilities to create cybersecurity, valve inspection and hydrant inspection programs. The Companys regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have access to utility valuation legislation and regulation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval. In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that include a methodology to value water and wastewater assets based upon the new replacement cost of the assets less the depreciation, in addition to other valuation methodology options. 7 Table of Contents Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a jurisdiction. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the jurisdiction. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high-quality services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Companys regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Competition The Companys Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, CPCNs) issued by state PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However, the Companys Regulated Businesses do face increasing competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, the Companys largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, include Essential Utilities, Inc., American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy, SouthWest Water Company and Corix Infrastructure, Inc. Condemnation and Eminent Domain All or portions of the Regulated Businesses utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or the jurisdiction of the particular CPCN. As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, the Monterey water service system assets (the Monterey system assets) of the Companys California subsidiary (Cal Am) are the subject of a potential condemnation action by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the MPWMD) stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. For more information on this matter, see Item 3Legal ProceedingsProposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets  Potential Condemnation. Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, for example, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance. Water Supply and Wastewater Services The Companys Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only. 8 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Companys Top Five States individually and the Regulated Businesses collectively for the year ended December 31, 2023: Surface Water Ground Water Purchased Water New Jersey 74% 20% 6% Pennsylvania 91% 7% 2% Missouri 84% 15% 1% Illinois 55% 35% 10% California % 67% 33% Regulated Businesses 71% 22% 7% The Companys ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of the Companys service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes the Company might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather. The Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. The Company reviews current climate science and global models related to temperature, precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis. Where actionable forecasts are available, the Company will use this information in its comprehensive planning studies and asset management plans. These studies and plans, which are used by the Company to develop its asset management and system reliability strategies, assess the climate risk and resiliency of the Companys water and wastewater systems over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number of different factors, projections and estimates. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. In California, where the state has recently experienced a multi-year drought, the Company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as various long-term purchase water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years. An example of the Companys use of long-term planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the Water Supply Project) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes Cal Ams purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the GWR Project) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of Cal Am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the SWRCB). For more information, see Item 3Legal ProceedingsAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions and Note 16Commitments and ContingenciesContingenciesAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations. 9 Table of Contents Seasonality Customer demand for the Companys water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is warmer and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Companys jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period that is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms. Affordability The Company supports the United Nations declaration of access to clean water and sanitation as a human right, regardless of economic status. As a water utility, the Companys water must be safe, efficient, reliable, accessible and affordable. Through increased efficiency, conservation and low-income support programs, on average across the enterprise, the Company consistently achieves water costs that are significantly below the EPAs suggested guidance of 2% of household income. Succeeding in water affordability positively affects the health and safety of the Companys customers and contributes to the economic prosperity of the communities in which it operates. The Companys approach to water access and affordability consists of two key strategies. The first is to supply water that is safe, reliable and meets the needs of its customers. The second is to provide affordable water services to customers while protecting its customers right to clean water, regardless of economic status or geographic location. The Company also focuses on addressing water affordability by maximizing both supply-side and demand-side efficiency. Average residential water bills for the Companys customers are approximately $55 to $65 per month, and the expected average annual rate increases across the Companys footprint over the next five years is 5% to 6%. The Company continues to advocate for federal and state customer affordability support and monitors the number of customers enrolled in its assistance programs to make sure that it is effectively responding to customer needs. Other Other primarily includes the MSG business, which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on military installations. The Contract Services Group (CSG), also included in Other, has three contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Companys Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS, income from assets not associated with the Regulated Businesses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. The businesses included within Other are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for Other were $314 million for 2023, $287 million for 2022 and $546 million for 2021, accounting for 7%, 8% and 14%, respectively, of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods. Military Services Group MSG operates on 18 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installations water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long-term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installations mission, and the construction of these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Companys debt or equity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. The U.S. Army has a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Armys implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing. However, recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year period after project completion. Four of MSGs current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity. 10 Table of Contents The contract price for four of MSGs contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 14 contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called Economic Price Adjustment. All 18 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the MSG subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs. MSGs backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $7.1 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 39 years. Sale of Homeowner Services Group On December 9, 2021 (the Closing Date), the Company sold all of the equity interests of the HOS subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company provided various warranty protection programs and other home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its HOS operations. See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Competition MSG faces competition from a number of service providers, including American States Water Company and Veolia Environnement S.A. Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation The Companys water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by its Regulated Businesses, MSG and CSG, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers. The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources, recognizing that drinking water standards have generally, over time, increased in number and become increasingly more stringent. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Companys capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $900 million over the next five years, and $200 million in 2024, to address water quality issues; most of which are focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations. 11 Table of Contents The Companys operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Companys water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use gaseous chlorine as well as other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the Company. The Companys facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Safe Drinking Water Act The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous, naturally occurring and manufactured chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Item 1BusinessResearch and DevelopmentContaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information. The Company is within the EPAs time frame for compliance with standards and rules developed under the regulation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements. Further, the EPA is actively considering development of a new regulation for perchlorate and updates to the current microbial and disinfection byproduct regulations. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2024. Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements. Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects, and in accordance with applicable state regulations and anticipation of updated federal regulation, the Company has been replacing lead service lines (LSLs) for many years in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. 12 Table of Contents On December 21, 2021, the EPA announced next steps to strengthen the regulatory framework on lead in drinking water, including implementing the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) and indicated an intent to finalize the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI) which were proposed on December 6, 2023, prior to October 16, 2024, the initial compliance date in the LCRR. The Company is executing an implementation strategy to comply with the initial LCRR requirement to complete a lead service line inventory. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the LCRI will be determined once the EPA finalizes the rule, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. The Company has provided both oral and written comments to the EPA on the proposed LCRI. The Company believes that, if the LCRI rulemaking were to be implemented, the total investment cost to identify and replace lead and galvanized steel service lines in the United States by 2037 would be significant and has been underestimated by the EPA in the LCRI rulemaking. Finally, the Company supports a delay of the compliance date for those portions of the LCRR proposed to be extended by the LCRI, some of which are currently scheduled to take effect on October 16, 2024, to allow all water service providers to prepare adequately for any changes that may be implemented through the proposed LCRI rulemaking while continuing to comply with the existing requirements. The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line replacement through drinking water state revolving funds. The Company will evaluate its service territories and apply for funding for those areas that meet applicable requirements. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Companys planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Companys preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the LCRR and proposed LCRI. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level. National Primary Drinking Water Regulations On March 14, 2023, the EPA announced the proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for six PFAS including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX Chemicals), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS). The proposed regulations would establish legally enforceable levels for PFAS in drinking water. The EPA anticipates issuing a final rule in 2024 and utilities will be provided a three-year window to comply with the new regulations once finalized, although the Safe Drinking Water Act allows utilities to request an additional two years if capital improvements are required. The Company performed an initial review of the NPDWR to assess the four parts per trillion requirements for PFOA and PFOS and the application of the Hazard Index approach for PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and GenX Chemicals. On May 24, 2023, the Company submitted comments to the EPA outlining its position on key issues to address the proposed regulations, including its projected costs associated with PFAS treatment at the proposed limits and the potential impact to customers bills. The Company estimates an investment of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities over a three to five-year period in order to comply with the proposed regulations. Additionally, the Company estimates annual operating expenses up to approximately $50 million related to testing and treatment in today's dollars. These are preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. The actual expenses may differ from these preliminary estimates and will be dependent upon multiple factors, including the final rule and effective date, as well as the completion of a system-by-system engineering analysis. The Company supports sound policies and compliance with the NPDWR by all water utilities, while protecting customers and communities from the costly burden of monitoring and mitigating PFAS contamination in water systems. The Company continues to advocate for policies that hold polluters accountable and is participating in the multi-district litigation and other lawsuits filed against certain PFAS manufacturers seeking damages and reimbursement of costs incurred and continuing to be incurred to address contamination of public water supply systems by PFAS. For more information on the PFAS multi-district litigation, see Item 3Legal ProceedingsPFAS Multi-District Litigation. 13 Table of Contents Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to the Companys wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on the Companys operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Companys facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. The EPA has identified wastewater discharge permitting and permits for the application of biosolids, or sewage sludge, containing PFAS as areas of focus in its PFAS Strategic Roadmap. Individual states may also take action in these areas. As indicated previously, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from any new requirements in these areas. Research and Development The Companys Research and Development Program The Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (R&D) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its compliance activities, improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Waters R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the teams expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, COVID-19, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, enteric viruses, and various bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Companys R&D personnel are located at the Companys corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports the Companys R&D activities through testing and analysis. The Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards and regulations. This relationship includes sharing of the Companys research, such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. The Companys engagement with the EPA provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements. The Company also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research foundations. The Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth. Contaminants of Emerging Concern Contaminants of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as PFAS, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistant genes (ARG), endocrine disrupting compounds, microplastics and industrial chemicals, as well as certain naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the publics health is not fully understood and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the publics perception of drinking water quality. The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 204 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that can affect humans. The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Companys efforts include:  monitoring impacts of environmental pathogen loads and removal through wastewater systems;  characterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their mitigation; 14 Table of Contents  advancing the science on holistic management strategies to improve distribution system water quality further;  using its research findings to communicate information to its customers regarding potential actions to limit occurrences of Legionella in their buildings; in this regard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems in large buildings;  defining a framework to support management or possible future regulation of opportunistic pathogens;  developing expanded monitoring methods for short-chain and fluorinated replacement PFAS;  systematically investigating PFAS removal from a variety of water matrices using established and emerging treatment technologies;  leading a PFAS risk communication strategy for the water sector;  using innovative technologies (e.g., satellite imagery) for early detection and response to algal blooms to manage public health impacts and prevent taste and odor events before cyanotoxins get into the water treatment plant;  monitoring of taste and odor issues that impact customer satisfaction using expanded analytical methods to detect compounds, and evaluating and recommending treatment practices;  implementing water source assessment tools, including sensors and data analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the identification of source water contamination events;  developing methodology and advanced measurement techniques for contaminants of emerging concern to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and  implementing activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange treatment to seek to control contaminants of emerging concern.

Alignment with Annual Performance Plan  The Companys Annual Performance Plan (APP), which provides annual, performance-based cash compensation to Company employees based upon the achievement of stated business goals, is aligned with its commitment to ESG principles. Performance measures and other mandatory training requirements related to the 2023 APP included the following:  Environmental: Drinking Water Quality and Program Compliance;  Social: Customer Satisfaction, Employee Safety and Employee Diversity; and  Governance: The Company requires annual completion of Code of Ethics training for an employee to be eligible to receive an APP payout. Reporting, Disclosures and Transparency  In 2023, the Company issued its seventh Sustainability Report as well as its ESG Data Summary, which covered performance and management of key metrics within the 2022 calendar year. American Water will begin publishing its Sustainability Report annually in 2024.  In addition, the Company issued its third annual Inclusion, Diversity & Equity (ID&E) Report, which describes the Companys inclusion and diversity strategies, practices, policies and programs. During 2023, the Company also continued to update key ID&E metrics quarterly on its DiversityatAW.com website.  As part of its continued commitment to transparency, the Company provided the following new disclosures:  Independent assurance of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for 2020, 2021 and 2022, in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised); 16 Table of Contents  EEO-1 data for 2022, marking the third consecutive reporting year that the Company has shared this information broadly;  A comparison of the Companys employee racial/ethnic diversity and residential customer diversity; and  A director skills and diversity matrix.  The Company also discloses on its website its Political Contribution Policy, and, on an annual basis, information related to political contributions, certain payments to tax-exempt organizations and trade associations (including Section 501(c)(4) organizations), and lobbying expenditures. Human Capital Resources Overview American Water is committed to supporting a high performing workforce, and the Company seeks to attract and retain employees who share the Companys purpose and values and represent the communities the Company serves. The Company demonstrates this commitment to its employees through its employee value proposition, called weCARE, which forms a central part of the Companys human capital resources mission and includes a focus on deeper connections, personal growth, shared purpose, flexibility and well-being. The Company believes that investing time, energy and resources in its workforce helps to generate new ideas, continuously improve operations, and provide high-quality, reliable service for the customers and communities served. Employee Health and Safety Safety has always been a core value at American Water and is a critical component of its business strategy. The Companys ultimate goal is to achieve zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Companys employees and contractors, all of whom deserve to return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Companys commitment to employee health and safety includes, in addition to physical safety, both emotional safety and overall wellbeing. To support the Companys commitment to safety, the Companys employees completed approximately 157,000 hours of employee safety training, including physical security and cybersecurity training, during 2023. To support and enhance the Companys safety culture, the Company also collaborates on local, regional, and national levels with its labor union partners. Employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by utilizing a number of safety practices embedded in the Companys culture, such as the use of (i) daily and pre-meeting safety messages, (ii) Stop Work Authority (the power to stop working immediately and mitigate a hazard whenever an employee believes a task is unsafe), and (iii) a peer-to-peer program in which employees observe and coach each other to encourage safe work. For 2023, the Company had an ORIR injury rate of 0.86, which reflects a 4% increase in injuries compared to 2022, taking into account a 1% increase in labor hours compared to 2022. Also, the number of Days Away Restricted or Transferred (DART) injuries increased by 43.5% compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in strain, sprain and tear injuries, which the Company has focused on addressing through safety action plans tailored to these types of injuries. For 2023, the Company had 54 injuries and its DART rate was 0.52 (33 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.85 (52 injuries) and a DART rate of 0.37 (23 injuries) in 2022. The Company continued its focus in 2023, to promote leading indicator safety activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near-miss reporting, and by supporting the achievement of internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near-miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner, increased by 32% in 2023 over 2022, and 98% of near-miss incident corrective actions were completed, with nearly 97% completed within 30 days. The Company utilizes near-miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance. This commitment to safety also includes building a culture of well-being where all employees can feel emotionally safe and live a healthy lifestyle. Through well-being education, the Company is able to encourage employees to take preventative actions and increase participation in annual well-care exams and cancer screenings. In 2023, the Company introduced an enhanced wellness program platform to increase overall engagement and to leverage the use of mobile technologies. As a result, 34% of enrolled employees reached the highest participation level in the wellness program (compared to 19% in 2022). In addition, the mobile-ready platform presented an opportunity to engage more front-line employees in a user-friendly way. Inclusion, Diversity and Equity The Company believes that employees are at their best when they can bring their full selves to work every day. This belief is the central component of the Companys Beautifully Different philosophy, which recognizes, embraces and celebrates the uniqueness of its employees. The Company also believes that having employees with different ideas, viewpoints, experiences and backgrounds improves its ability to serve a diverse customer base. To this end, the Company is committed to seeking and promoting diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, to align the diversity of the Companys workforce with the diversity of the communities in which it serves. 17 Table of Contents As part of its APP, the Company has included diversity goals intended to increase the representation of women in, and the ethnic and racial diversity of, the Companys workforce. The goals measure the percentage of females and racial/ethnic diversity among the Companys workforce based on voluntary self-identification. The Company maintains its DiversityatAW.com website to provide transparency and communicate progress on the Companys initiatives. This website currently includes, among other information, American Waters overall strategic approach to ID&E, the Companys ID&E report, its EEO-1 data, key employee diversity metrics (which are updated quarterly), and a discussion of the Companys pay equity study and internal labor market analysis. During 2023, the Company continued to focus on creating a culture that respects and supports inclusion, diversity and equity. At all levels, the Company strives to understand, respect, value and provide equal opportunity to each employee, and to foster an environment where employees differences are embraced and celebrated. The Company holds as an essential concept the right of employees to proudly share their ideas and unique perspectives in an environment built on mutual respect, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to diversity among its workforce, including its executive and senior management leadership teams, by reflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves. The Company expects all leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity. During 2023, 85.0% of the Companys hiring candidate pools were diverse. Additionally, for 2023, approximately 48.2% of the Companys internal employee transfers and promotions were filled with a diverse individual, reflecting the Companys commitment to employee development and career growth as well as the Companys focus on workforce inclusion, diversity and equity. For purposes of these metrics, diversity refers to gender, race, ethnicity, disability, veteran/military spouse status, and LGBTQ status, all based on voluntary, self-identified employee information. The Company maintains active partnerships with groups such as Hiring our Heroes, Military Spouse Employment Partnership, American Corporate Partners, CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, Disability: IN, Paradigm for Parity, and Out and Equal, to further enhance its ability to recruit and retain diverse employees. Among its recognitions, the Company was honored as a 2023 VETS Indexes 3-Star Employer and earned the 2024 Military Friendly Gold Employer designation for the Companys efforts in hiring and supporting U.S. military veterans. American Water was also recognized as the first utility to receive the Friendly Forces 5 STAR Reservist Friendly Employer award, the highest employer rating for Guard service personnel and reservists. The Company was also a top scorer in the 2023 Disability Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year and was recognized by 50/50 Women on Boards for a gender-balanced board of directors, Fortunes Modern Board 25 Ranking, as well as a Champion of Board Diversity with distinction by the Forum of Executive Women. The Company was also named a 2023 Best of the Decade honoree by Minority Business News USA and Womens Enterprise USA, and the Company was included in the 2023 Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment ETF. In keeping with the Companys values, the Company has a stated zero-tolerance approach against discrimination, harassment or retaliation by or toward any employee, vendor, customer or other person in its workplace. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and inclusion and diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to all employees, which includes instructions on using the Companys anonymous hotline for reporting potential Code of Ethics violations. The Companys five Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs), which represent diverse employee demographics (Women, African American/Black, LGBTQ, and Disabilities/Caregivers, with Military added in 2023), strive to create measurable and long-lasting positive impacts on employees careers, as well as the Companys culture and communities in which it serves. EBRG members participate in events and awareness activities throughout the year, which highlight the importance of building an inclusive and equitable culture. For example, employees may participate in monthly meetings with a focus on various related topics, including career development, psychological safety, cultural awareness or business objectives. EBRG members also have the opportunity to impact the communities in which the Company serves through service projects, including the annual Juneteenth Unity Walk that supported the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an organization that provides advocacy, education, and support for, and public awareness of, mental illness, and projects supported by a partnership with Girl Scout troops to promote environmental stewardship and the importance of careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, among others. Total Rewards In order to attract, retain and motivate a skilled, high-performing and diverse workforce, American Water provides a comprehensive and highly competitive Total Rewards program, including base pay, APP, long-term performance plan compensation for certain leadership positions, and a wide range of benefits consisting of, among others: medical, prescription, dental, vision, life and disability insurance coverage, a retirement savings plan, an employee stock purchase plan, educational assistance, paid time off through holidays and vacation and sick time. The Companys Total Rewards offerings also include a health and wellness program and a menu of additional voluntary benefits. 18 Table of Contents All the Companys employees, including those who are union-represented, participate in the APP to promote alignment between performance-based compensation and the achievement of the Companys short-term performance goals. In addition, as part of its commitment to providing an inclusive and equitable culture for all employees, the Company regularly reviews its success in achieving pay equity, whereby pay decisions would be based on the responsibilities, talents and skills of its employees, rather than unrelated factors such as gender, race or ethnicity. All employees who average 30 hours or more per week are eligible for full-time benefits. Approximately 89% of all benefit eligible employees are enrolled in the Companys healthcare benefits. Full-time employees pay approximately 16% of the total premium cost of medical, dental and vision coverage. To reinforce the Companys commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity, the Companys medical benefits include coverage for applied behavior analysis, autism treatment, transgender services and hearing aids, as well as a fertility assistance benefit. In addition, in 2023, the Company increased its paid family leave benefit for employees from two weeks to six weeks. Talent Development The Company partners with business leaders to understand the key behaviors and competencies required to operate safely and effectively, and to meet our short and long-term business objectives. The Company applied its workforce planning process in 2023, to assess key positions across the organization, identify potential talent risks, and begin building action plans to mitigate those risks. In addition, the Company worked to create and deploy programs designed to attract, motivate, develop and retain talented employees, and foster a learning culture. In 2023, the Company enhanced its employee learning goal, which provided an opportunity for employees to complete a minimum of 25 hours of learning through a variety of methods, including: on-the-job experiences and challenges; teaching others; and traditional instructor-led or remote learning opportunities. The Company believes that personal growth is a valuable component of weCARE and is committed to supporting strategies to help its employees develop both personally and professionally. Approximately 95% of active, full-time employees hired before October 1, 2023, met the employee learning goal, resulting in approximately 328,000 hours of total training completed during the year. In addition to required role-based training, managers assist employees to identify professional development opportunities, utilizing a framework of on-the-job learning, social learning and formal learning, to help them attempt to reach their full potential and grow their careers. To further support employees growth and development, during 2023, the Company expanded the employee profile fields within its employee information system to allow employees to showcase their achievements, contributions and aspirations, as well as to support identification of developing and key talent. Developing talent to provide a pathway to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2023, the Company engaged in succession planning activities for the Companys business-critical and business-impact positions. These succession plans support the Companys business continuity plans and goals, through the identification and development of current and future leaders, and promote diversity, retention and talent development priorities. In addition to succession planning for executive and senior leadership roles, in 2023, the Company conducted local and enterprise-wide talent reviews, identifying top and emerging talent with a focus on diversity, strengths, gaps and development needs against the critical skills needed for certain roles. Through these talent review processes, business leaders identified a pool of high-potential employees, which will assist the Company in supporting their career goals and aspirations and promote more effective employee experience and talent retention efforts. The Company also utilizes annual six-month mentoring programs designed to accelerate emerging leaders abilities to demonstrate leadership capabilities and relationships, with the guidance of an experienced executive mentor. Finally, in 2023, the Company, together with an outside vendor, initiated a new pilot program, called Accelerate for Impact, to support development of its high-potential employees key competencies. Accelerate for Impact provides select high-potential employees the opportunity to engage in social learning activities and to complete self-directed, online coursework that culminates with a capstone project. Employee Experience The Company has established its weCARE employee value proposition that focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employees opinions and emotional response about the Company as an employer. weCARE is composed of five elements: deeper connections; personal growth; shared purpose; flexibility; and well-being. weCARE represents the Companys commitment to valuing its employees and building a safe, healthy and inclusive culture where employees know their value and are appreciated for their talents and commitment to supporting the Companys success. The Company offers employee programs covering each of the five components of weCARE. The Company is committed to improving the employee experience by listening to employees through focus group discussions and employee surveys, among other tools. To that end, the Company captures employee feedback, which helps the Company understand how employees are feeling and permits appropriate refinement of the Companys employee programs, benefits and support. In early 2023, the Company administered an evolved engagement survey, seeking to capture a view of the Companys employee experience, pursuant to which the Company received actionable feedback on each of these weCARE elements. 19 Table of Contents Workforce Data As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 6,500 employees. For 2023, the Companys employee turnover rate, which the Company defines as the ratio of the number of separated employees to the 12-month average headcount during 2023, was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2022. American Water seeks to reduce regrettable employee turnover by assessing the effectiveness of weCARE and through its efforts to foster the Companys employee experience. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of the Companys workforce was represented under 73 collective bargaining agreements with 14 different unions. In 2023, the Company renegotiated 21 collective bargaining agreements that were set to expire during the year. During 2024, 21 of the Companys collective bargaining agreements will expire in accordance with their terms and the Company expects to be able to negotiate these agreements during the year. In addition, the Companys national benefits agreement, which expires on July 31, 2028, covers approximately 3,000 of the Companys union-represented employees and their families and provides them with healthcare and other benefits. The Company also collaborates with union leadership on topics such as safety, customer, technology and employee benefits in forums such as the Joint Healthcare Committee, National Labor Management Committee and the annual Labor Management Conference. In 2023, the Company initiated a joint effort with certain of these labor unions and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to host local discussions among management and union leaders with the goal of supporting and enhancing constructive relationships with these unions. Board Oversight The Executive Development and Compensation Committee (ED&CC) of the Board of Directors establishes and reviews the Companys overall compensation philosophy and oversees the compensation and benefits plans and programs for its executive officers. The ED&CC oversees the process of planning for executive officer succession. It also provides oversight of the Companys inclusion, diversity and equity programs and initiatives. Further, the ED&CC is responsible for reviewing and assessing, at least annually, the Companys culture and related culture engagement, its organizational and leadership development plans and programs, and its programs designed to identify, attract and retain high-potential employees.

=== ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ===

RISK FACTORS We operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations Our Regulated Businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our Regulated Businesses also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these regulatory requirements. Our Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request in an amount that is sufficient to:  recover our cost of operations, including: purchased water; chemicals; and fuel, power and other commodities used in our operations;  recover our operational labor and labor-related expenses, including without limitation costs and expenses associated with our pension and other post-employment benefits;  enable us to recover our investment; and  provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment. Approval by the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our Regulated Businesses, which are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain cases, affiliated transactions. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business. In any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if the rates approved are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on equity permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditions exist, including, but not limited to, (i) water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, (ii) customers increase their conservation efforts, (iii) we experience unusual or emergent situations, events or conditions, (iv) we experience a significant increase in customers without recovery of the operating and other costs associated with serving them, or a decrease in customers that causes a decrease in operating revenue, or (v) our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates. It may be difficult to predict the outcome or impact of these events on us or the actions that may be taken by the PUCs or other governmental authorities in response thereto. Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations, including with respect to contaminants of emerging concern, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures, and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation. Our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These requirements include, among others, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCR (as amended), and each of their implementing rules and regulations, as well as other federal and state requirements. For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If the water or wastewater services we provide to our customers do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves 22 Table of Contents providing water service for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry. In addition, CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. We incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations and their enforcement, have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements, such as the anticipated EPA drinking water regulations for PFAS, the LCRR and the proposed LCRI, could increase our costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination, including potential releases of hazardous chemicals, such as gaseous chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of residual waste or caused an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Attention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; PFAS; bacteria, microbes, viruses, amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, we believe these contaminants will continue to form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations. Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies because of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services. Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams, groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources, are held in the public trust and are not generally owned by private interests. As a result, we typically do not own the source water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights (determined by legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities or by entering into water purchase agreements. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. If we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For example, in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with the cease and desist orders issued by the SWRCB in July 1995 and October 2009 (the 1995 Order, the 2009 Order and, as amended in July 2016, the 2016 Order and, collectively, the Orders) that require Cal Am to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminated on December 31, 2021. See Item 3Legal ProceedingsAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additional information regarding this matter. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the Orders may result in material additional costs or obligations, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders, which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business, results of operations and cash flows. 23 Table of Contents Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Service interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses. These include, among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, pandemics and epidemics, severe electrical storms, sinkholes, solar flares and chemical spills or other contamination causing temporary unavailability of our source water supplies. Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts. Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Seasonal and other drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, we cannot be certain that any such expenses incurred will, in fact, be fully recovered. Moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after a drought has ended and restrictions are lifted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise. The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as:  increased frequency and duration of droughts;  increased precipitation and flooding;  increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;  challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;  potential degradation of water quality;  decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;  increases in the number, length and severity of disruptions in service;  increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or  increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems. Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, both Federal and state laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that seek to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions and require or would require additional reporting, monitoring and disclosure, and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs, in whole or in part. 24 Table of Contents The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as regulatory lag, from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements, incur increased operating expenses as a result of inflation or other factors, incur increased cost of capital, including as a result of increasing short- and long-term interest rates, or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in general rate cases; our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag or the impacts thereof could adversely affect our business. There is typically a delay, known as regulatory lag, between the time our Regulated Businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase, including as a result of inflation or other factors, and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on the volume of water used in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag or the impacts thereof could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, two of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced usage, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 10 o f our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC-approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rate s, nine of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a general rate case is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or costs for power or other fuel, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case process without the mechanisms. While these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek approval of regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms may not continue in their current form, or at all, or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future. Although we intend to continue our efforts to seek state PUC approval of constructive regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, or even if partially successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. Changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our Regulated Businesses is uncertain. Changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws and regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees. Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes of the individuals who serve as regulators and changes in the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences, among others:  making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;  changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings;  restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts;  requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;  limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets, or issue long-term debt or equity, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;  negatively impacting, among other things: (i) tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, (ii) the availability or amount of, or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of, tax credits or tax 25 Table of Contents abatement benefit, (iii) the amount of taxes owed or paid, including as a result of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax provisions, (iv) the timing of tax effects on rates or (v) the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;  increasing the associated costs of, and/or of difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water quality accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject;  changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;  making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;  increasing the costs and/or difficulty of complying with proposed changes to federal contractor affirmative action audits;  placing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;  restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and  revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC or other governmental authority. Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities. The wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. If collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our wastewater systems have commercial and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type, character and concentration of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge into our systems. The failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could, in turn, negatively impact our operations, damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements. Liabilities resulting from such exceedance events could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our Regulated Businesses. Adverse economic conditions may cause our customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent. Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts. Our Regulated Businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, experience increases in short- and long-term interest rates or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects. The water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2023, we invested $2.6 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and, we believe, will increase. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing through current or future sources of liquidity, we may be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our capital investment strategies or expand our rate base to enable us to meet our growth targets. Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as a result of supply chain interruptions, construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, legal and regulatory challenges, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M expenses and other costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results. We have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including water and sewer mains, pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities. Additionally, we may have limited information regarding buried and newly acquired assets, which 26 Table of Contents could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices. Assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure. Failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M expenses and other costs. In addition, failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues. The volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues. Two of our jurisdictions, California and Illinois, currently have revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a general rate case, regardless of sales volume. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, our operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality. Contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations, government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation. The water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system, or the water service that is provided to our customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from manufactured sources (such as perchlorate, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, methyl tertiary butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, lead and other materials, or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks or other similar incidents. In addition, new categories of contaminants continue to emerge in the water industry. If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) limiting use of the water supply under a Do Not Use protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply, in whole or in part, potentially impacting basic sanitation and fire protection needs. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms, and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies. See Item 3Legal Proceedings for information on certain pending lawsuits related to interruptions of water service. Since we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to our customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. We may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances within the water supply or distributed finished drinking water. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles and other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions. Our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and, as a result, we are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of water service, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, content, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of our operations may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less 27 Table of Contents favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory investigations or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include negative investigative conclusions and/or findings, the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our long-term contracts related to MSG, a s well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 74 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams. The failure of any of these dams could result in personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. We also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material. The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail material costs. Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to recover costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes, water mains and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation. Our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes, water mains and storage systems located across the United States. A failure of major pipes, mains or reservoirs could result in injuries, property and other damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes, mains and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators, including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be recovered through rate adjustments. An important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems, which involves risks, including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business. An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems to broaden our current, and move into new, service areas. We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates, and whether or not any particular acquisition is successfully completed, these activities are expensive and time consuming and are subject to the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions. As consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewater industries and competition from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other strategic and financial buyers continues to increase, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and our ability to expand through acquisitions may otherwise be limited. The negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our managements time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:  unanticipated capital expenditures;  unanticipated acquisition-related expenses;  incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations, including liabilities that were unknown or undisclosed at the time of acquisition; 28 Table of Contents  failure to recover acquisition adjustments or premiums due to unfavorable decisions by PUCs and other governmental authorities;  failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;  recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;  fluctuations in quarterly and/or annual results;  failure to realize anticipated or perceived benefits and synergies, such as desired return on equity or profitability, cost savings and revenue enhancements; and  difficulties in integrating or assimilating acquired systems operations, personnel, benefits, services and systems and water quality, cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures. Some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, state laws on acquisition treatment or PUC interpretation thereof may affect our ability to recover costs associated with our investments in newly-acquired water and wastewater systems and any difficulties we encounter in the negotiation, execution or integration process could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting. Our Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition. Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States, and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition. For example, on December 15, 2023, the MPWMD filed eminent domain litigation against Cal Am in Monterey County Superior Court with respect to the Monterey system assets. See Item 3Legal ProceedingsProposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets  Potential Condemnation for additional information regarding this matter. Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits. Contesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through eminent domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. We may be subject to physical and cyber attacks. As operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of violence, war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our reputation, customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access to their operational or technology systems. While we have instituted what we believe are reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful to prevent or mitigate a cyber attack. 29 Table of Contents If, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen; we could experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; we could suffer a loss or redirection of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations; we may be subject to increased regulatory requirements; and we may experience litigation and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Applicable laws and regulations or contracts may require us to report cybersecurity incidents or breaches or securely maintain confidential data in the event that we experience a physical or cyber security incident. Our efforts to comply with such laws and regulations or contractual provisions, or our failure to do so, may cause us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, and their resulting impacts, either to our facilities or assets, those of third parties, or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about our customers and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that have been and will continue to be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack on us or a vendor could also subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others. We have obtained insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a physical attack, cyber attack or a security breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by an attack or a breach. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a physical attack, cyber attack or security breach incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. Our business is subject to complex and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding consumer privacy and the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, which could result in, among other things, public disclosure of incidents, private or governmental claims or litigation against us, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased cost of operations. Laws and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly with respect to data and consumer privacy, security and protection. We are subject to an increasing number of complex and continually evolving data and consumer privacy, security and protection laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local governments, including, for example, the California Privacy Rights Act, together with its amendments and implementing regulations, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022. New laws and regulations may require us to disclose incidents to authorities, regulators and/or the public, when we otherwise may not have been required to disclose such incidents under previous laws and regulations, and such disclosures could negatively and materially impact our reputation, customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection, use and dissemination of data. Moreover, we expect that current laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States will continue to evolve and increase, and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws, regulations or standards will have on us or on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with current or future federal, state, or local data or consumer privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, guidance, industry standards, or legal obligations, or any incident resulting in unauthorized access to, or the acquisition, release, or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees and others, may result in private or governmental enforcement actions, litigation or other claims against us, fines and penalties, or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses. These events could also require us to change our business practices, and the events or such changes may result in significant diversions of resources, distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured. We maintain insurance coverage, some of which may be self-insured, as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, workers compensation, employers liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage, or for which we are self-insured and must therefore utilize our own financial resources to cover such losses. Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. 30 Table of Contents We rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships, and a failure or disruption of implemented technology could materially and adversely affect our business. Technology is an integral part of our business and operations, and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We use technology systems to, among other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, create and manage our financial records and other operational data, track assets, remotely monitor our plants and facilities, and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend on water meters to record and communicate the amount of water our customers use, which information in turn is used to generate customer bills, and in recent years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the Regulated Businesses. When failures occur, we work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters or other implemented technology will be successful in the future and that these or future failures of water meters or other technological issues will not have a material adverse effect on us. Although we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations, our technology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things: failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems; loss or failure of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees, contractors and other third parties. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. An inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant part of our long-term strategic plan focuses on safety, operational excellence, cost and expense efficiency (includin g O&M expense efficiency), water quality and affordability, asset and capital management and the customer experience. For example, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing, deploying, integrating, enhancing and maintaining customer-facing technologies, applications to support field service and customer service operations, water source sensor and evaluation technologies, meter data management and analytics, and intelligent automation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies. Because these efforts can be long-term in nature, these new technologies may be more costly or time-consuming than expected to design, develop, integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended cost and expense, including O&M expense, ef ficiencies or other key performance results and, ultimately, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability. Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of managements time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions (including, without limitation, in connection with the installation or upgrade of our enterprise resource planning systems, and to support our cybersecurity program), and have installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods, such as pipe, chemicals, power and other fuel, equipment, water and other raw materials, and services, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers, as well as our financial results. Our ability to serve our customers and operate our business in compliance with regulatory requirements is dependent upon purchasing or securing necessary goods and services from our suppliers and vendors. These items include but are not limited to 31 Table of Contents contracted services, chemicals, pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings, equipment (including personal protective equipment), water, and power and other fuel. Examples of supply chain disruptions include reduced quantities of goods available in the marketplace, delays in manufacturing or shipping goods, labor shortages at our suppliers or vendors, natural or other disasters and operational impacts to some of our suppliers or vendors. Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods and services have occurred and we anticipate will continue to occur into the foreseeable future. Supply chain disruptions may cause us to be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain needed goods or services at a reasonable price or at all, and may significantly increase the price of goods and services we may obtain from suppliers and vendors. This, in turn, may adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers in compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as our associated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we attempt to plan for and have contingencies in place to address supply chain disruptions, our mitigation efforts may not be successful or may have further negative impacts on us. Our business has inherently dangerous work sites. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life, and be exposed to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities. Safety is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries are critical to our ability to carry out our operations effectively and to serve our customers, and thereby, to support our reputation. We maintain health and safety practices to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. At our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanical operating equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, electric and gas utility lines, below grade trenches and vaults, electrical and pneumatic hazards, fall from height hazards, suspended loads, hazardous chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements. As an essential business that provides water and wastewater services, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees, contractors, vendors, customers and others who work at or visit our worksites. If the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees, contractors or others, or we fail to implement procedures, our employees, contractors and others may experience illness, or minor, serious or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our operations can involve the delivery, handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly delivered, handled, stored, used or disposed of, or if the location and identification of these chemicals are not reported accurately or timely, serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage could result, and we could be subjected to fines, penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to various environmental, transportation and occupational health and safety regulations. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective environmental health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization, including construction sites and operating facilities, the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability. Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 73 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, 21 of which are scheduled to expire during 2024, are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts, or enter into new agreements, on terms that are acceptable to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations, may disrupt our operations, negatively impact the ability to serve our customers, and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financial, Economic and Market-Related Risks Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2023, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was $12.4 billion, and our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was in a deficit position. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures; 32 Table of Contents  exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;  limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;  impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;  requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;  limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt. During 2023, we utilized existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program, to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In order to meet our capital expenditure and other operational needs, however, we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Moreover, additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness. Debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2024, 2025 and 2026 will be $475 million, $619 million and $1,478 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms. We have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements. See Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly mark to market valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by the financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely. Our inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our long-term commitments or liquidity needs at reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to cash from operations, during 2023, we relied on a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, a $2.60 billion commercial paper program, and the debt and equity capital markets, to satisfy our liquidity needs. Historically, we have regularly used our commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally could obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, $180 million of commercial paper outstanding and $75 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost. Our ability to comply with covenants in our revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, under the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit, lenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and payable. Events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. To avoid such a default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur 33 Table of Contents indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete. As provided in our five-year capital plan, in order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we intend to issue a combination of short-term and long-term debt securities and/or additional equity shares of common stock. Disruptions in the debt or equity capital markets or changes in our credit ratings or other events could limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While the lending banks that participate in the revolving credit facility have to date honored their commitments under those facilities, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industrys financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. In such a case, we may not be able to access the commercial paper, debt or equity capital markets, or other sources of potential liquidity, in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew or replace commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Short- or long-term disruptions or volatility in the debt or equity capital and credit markets as a result of economic, legislative, political or other uncertainties, including as a result of changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the capital necessary to provide adequate liquidity for our business. Significant volatility or disruptions in the debt or equity capital or credit markets, or financial institution failures, could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include delaying or deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Finally, even absent significant volatility or disruptions in the capital markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access markets to obtain capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could expose us to increased interest or other expense, require us to institute cash or liquidity conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, which may limit or impair our ability to achieve our strategic, business and operational goals and objectives. The conditional exchange feature of the Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026, if triggered, may adversely effect our liquidity and financial condition and may dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders or may otherwise depress the price of parent companys common stock. In June 2023, AWCC issued $1,035.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes). See Note 11Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Notes. In the event the conditional exchange feature of the Notes is triggered and one or more holders elect to exchange their Notes, AWCC would be required to settle any exchanged principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, in that case, even if holders do not elect to exchange their Notes, we would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. If AWCC elects to settle the portion, if any, of an exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being exchanged in shares of parent company common stock or a combination of cash and shares of such common stock, any sales in the public market of the common stock deliverable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of parent company common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the exchange of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, and any anticipated exchange of the Notes for shares of such common stock could depress the price of such common stock. Parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds. Parent company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Parent companys ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and our covenants and other agreements. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations. 34 Table of Contents We have a significant amount of goodwill and other assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and we may be required to record impairments or changes in fair value to these assets, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our assets as of December 31, 2023, included $1.1 billion of goodwill and $236 million of total assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, in the past, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets, and have recorded changes in fair value of financial instruments and other assets. We may be required to recognize in the future an impairment of goodwill or a change in fair value of financial instruments or certain other assets due to market conditions, other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business, or other circumstances that may impact the fair value of a financial instrument or the other asset. See Note 18Fair Value of Financial Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the fair value of financial and other assets. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in control premiums, or other circumstances. A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill and changes in fair value of certain of our other assets would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment or change occurred, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment or change could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators. Market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us to provide significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date or a change in the projection of the future return on plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and others. If interest rates are lower at the current measurement date than the prior measurement date, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in assumptions, such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that the discount rate used in our assumptions is reduced, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additional Risks Related to Other Businesses Parent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our Other businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced. Under the terms of certain agreements under which our Other businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and federal governmental entities, parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations, including financial guarantees or deposits. In the event these obligations are not performed, the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2023, we had remaining performance commitments, as measured by remaining contract revenue, and primarily related to MSGs contracts, totaling approximately $7.8 billion, of which $1.2 billion are guaranteed by parent company and the remainder is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries in Other. The aggregate amount of remaining performance commitments is likely to increase as the number of military bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms. 35 Table of Contents MSGs operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the U.S. government. MSG enters into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment, or a price redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. General Risk Factors New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure. Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated or unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified, skilled and/or diverse talent. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified, skilled and/or diverse talent, including engineers, licensed operators, water quality, regulatory and management professionals who have the desired experience and expertise. Similar to other organizations, the Company may have challenges implementing its human capital management, recruitment and employee succession plans to attract and retain such talent based on a number of factors including, among others, market conditions, retirements and geography. If we are unable to meet these human capital resource challenges, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted. Our business may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees and contractors. Our Code of Ethics requires employees and contractors to make decisions ethically and in compliance with applicable law and regulatory requirements, and our Code of Ethics and its underlying policies, practices and procedures. All employees are required to complete training on and review the Code of Ethics on an annual basis, and violations of the Code of Ethics could result in disciplinary actions up to, and including, termination. Despite these efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees or contractors to engage in intentional misconduct and violate laws and regulations through, among other things, theft, fraud, misappropriation, bribery, corruption and engaging in conflicts of interest or related person transactions, or otherwise committing serious breaches of our Code of Ethics and our policies, practices and procedures. Intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY The Companys Cybersecurity Program The Companys cybersecurity program is an integral part of the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the Companys operational and technology environment. To protect the integrity of its data and operational and technology systems, the Company employs a defense-in-depth strategy that uses multiple security measures. This strategy aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective, and responsive measures to identify and manage risks. The Company periodically reviews and modifies the implementation of its cybersecurity strategy based on threat trends, program maturity, the results of assessments, and the advice of third-party security consultants. The Companys cybersecurity program includes the following areas of focus:  Technology that includes, among other things, encryption, threat management, monitoring, investigation support and backups for physical devices, such as mobile phones and computers, connected to the Company network;  Identity and access management controls that include, among other things, multi-factor authentication and safeguards associated with granting elevated privileges;  Proactive cybersecurity processes, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and periodic program assessments by outside security consultants and assessors;  Reactive cybersecurity processes that are regularly evaluated using various incident response and disaster recovery exercises;  Employee cyber risk awareness and training, including regular simulation exercises with employees, that covers cybersecurity threats and actions to prevent and report attacks; and  Third-party risk management and security standards, including due diligence, continuous monitoring, cyber risk scoring and contractual obligations, and periodic review of third-party control environments to align the Companys risk exposure with its business requirements and risk tolerances. Third-Party Relationships The Company utilizes partners and third-party service providers to help deliver safe and reliable water and wastewater services across its regulated operations and has implemented a third-party risk management program to understand the cybersecurity risks to the Company that may arise out of these third-party relationships. The Company categorizes third-party relationships by risk level, which is determined primarily by the service provided by the third-party and its level of access to the Companys data. Each category has specific cybersecurity controls, data privacy and documentation requirements, which are outlined in the agreement between the Company and the third-party service provider. In addition, the Company evaluates the online security footprint for its service providers at the time of agreement, and on a regular basis, thereafter, depending on the providers risk level. The Company reviews its agreements with third-party service providers periodically related to terms and conditions governing cybersecurity controls and data privacy. The Company also monitors, as appropriate, risks relating to potential compromises of sensitive Company information through third parties and reevaluates these risks periodically. In addition, the Company obtains annual attestation reports related to data security and privacy from certain third-party providers to further support compliance with industry-standard cybersecurity protocols. Cybersecurity Risks The Company believes that its current preventative actions and response activities provide reasonable measures of protection against security breaches and serve generally to reduce the Companys overall cybersecurity risk. However, cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have and will continue to become more frequent and sophisticated. Although the Company has implemented measures that it believes are reasonable to safeguard its operational and technology systems and has sought to establish a culture of continuous monitoring and improvement, the evolving nature of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities means that these protections may not always be effective. In addition, the Company has obtained insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a cyber attack or a security breach, but such insurance is subject to exclusions, limitations and exceptions, and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by an attack or breach. To date, management has determined that no cybersecurity incident experienced by the Company has resulted in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or business strategy. For additional information concerning cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1ARisk FactorsWe may be subject to physical and cyber attacks, and We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured. 37 Table of Contents Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy The Company has established an enterprise-wide cybersecurity program designed to prevent disruption to critical information systems, minimize the loss or manipulation of sensitive information, and to timely identify, escalate and promptly remediate and recover from cybersecurity incidents and facilitate compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. To oversee cybersecurity risk management, the Company employs a dedicated unit, led by the Companys Chief Security Officer (CSO), to implement cybersecurity controls, assess and report on cybersecurity risks and consult with the Companys internal Enterprise Risk Management Committee, a decision-making body which supports and oversees the identification, assessment, prioritization, and mitigation strategies for enterprise-level risks, including cybersecurity risks. The Companys CSO has 23 years of work experience in the cybersecurity field throughout various industries, including the utility sector, and has obtained several professional certifications, including from the International Information System Security Certification Consortium. The CSO reports directly to the Company's Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is responsible for the Companys information technology program. The CIO has over 25 years of work experience in the information technology, physical security and cybersecurity fields, including previously serving as the Companys CSO, and holds the Certified Protection Professional, Professional Certified Investigator and Physical Security Professional certifications from ASIS International. The CIO serves on the Water Sector Coordinating Council (WSCC), an advisory body comprised of representatives from various U.S. water and wastewater organizations, which serves as a policy, strategy and coordination mechanism for the water sector on critical infrastructure security and resilience issues. In that role, the CIO partners with representatives from the Department of Homeland Security and the EPA on U.S. water and wastewater sector initiatives. The CIO is also the former Chair of the WSCC, the National Association of Water Companies Safety and Security Committee, and the ASIS Utility Security Council. The Companys security team provides oversight and policy guidance on physical, cyber and information security, as well as business continuity, throughout the Companys operations. It is responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring and supporting effective physical and technical security controls for the Companys physical assets, business systems and operational technologies. The Companys security team also conducts annual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training and education for the Companys employees. In 2023, 100% of the Companys active workforce completed mandatory cybersecurity training. By equipping employees with knowledge and skills, the Company strives to cultivate and maintain a cybersecurity-conscious culture within its workforce. The Companys cybersecurity risk assessment process involves considering risks associated with the nature of its business, receiving and processing inputs from internal and external stakeholders, monitoring industry trends and risks and engaging external advisors, to assist in aligning the Companys cybersecurity processes with industry best practices. Risk assessments are conducted quarterly and annually to evaluate the effectiveness of the Companys existing security controls and serve as the basis for additional safeguards, security controls and measures. Operational and technical security controls are deployed and integrated as safeguards against unauthorized access to the Companys information systems. These controls are aimed at (i) assuring the continuity of business processes that are dependent upon automation, (ii) maintaining the integrity of the Companys data, (iii) supporting regulatory and legislative compliance requirements, and (iv) maintaining safe and reliable service to the Companys customers. The Company has also implemented a vulnerability assessment program that is conducted at least annually and more frequently, depending on the nature of the risk. This process serves as a guiding enterprise-wide framework to outline the scope and procedures of the Companys cybersecurity risk management processes. By prioritizing vulnerability management and continuously evaluating the Companys internal and external environments for vulnerabilities, the Company aims to implement preventative measures to protect its information assets and technology-based infrastructure from cybersecurity threats. This approach helps to reduce the Companys exposure to material cybersecurity threat risks. Incident Response The Company utilizes an established internal framework designed to assess promptly the severity and materiality of cybersecurity incidents based on predefined quantitative and qualitative criteria and to determine the appropriate level of response. Incidents are escalated to the relevant management teams based on their severity and materiality for prompt response and mitigation. The Company maintains a standing crisis response team comprised of individuals from various functional units, including without limitation Information Technology, Legal, Finance, Enterprise Risk Management, Operations and Communications, to respond to cybersecurity and physical security incidents, environmental incidents and health and safety emergencies, among others. If a cybersecurity incident were to occur, the Company would establish a cross-functional incident response team to respond to the specific cybersecurity incident. The incident response team would consist of a subset of members from the standing crisis response team, including personnel with the most relevant experience related to the specific incident. This collaborative approach is intended to enable the Company to leverage expertise throughout the business to address cybersecurity events and to evaluate the potential financial, legal, operational and reputational implications of an incident, or series of related incidents. In considering the materiality of an event, related attacks, whether in terms of quantity or impact, are reviewed individually and in the aggregate to determine whether they may have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or business strategy, either quantitatively or qualitatively. 38 Table of Contents Cybersecurity Governance The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of the Companys cybersecurity program and the Companys responses to cybersecurity risk. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Safety, Environmental, Technology and Operations (SETO) Committee of the Board of Directors responsibility for the oversight and review of technology policy, strategy and governance, and cybersecurity issues that could impact the Companys operational performance or risk profile. The SETO Committee meets at least quarterly and receives reports from the CIO and CSO related to cybersecurity threats, trends and risks, and related mitigation activities. In addition, the SETO Committee and the Board of Directors receive reports of periodic external assessments and internal testing of the effectiveness of the Companys cybersecurity program. The SETO Committee coordinates with the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, as appropriate, on matters related to cybersecurity risk. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls and the Companys risk assessment and management strategy, including with respect to cybersecurity risks. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Companys properties consist primarily of (i) water and wastewater treatment plants, (ii) mains and pipes used for transmission, distribution and collection of water and wastewater, (iii) wells and other sources of water supply, such as reservoirs, (iv) water and wastewater pumping stations, (v) meters and fire hydrants, (vi) general structures, including buildings, dams and treated water storage facilities, (vii) land and easements, (viii) vehicles, (ix) software rights, and (x) other equipment and facilities, the majority of which are used directly in the operation of its systems. Substantially all of the Companys properties are owned by its subsidiaries, with a large percentage subject to liens of its mortgage bonds. A wholly owned subsidiary of parent company owns the Companys corporate headquarters, located in Camden, New Jersey, and the Company and its operating subsidiaries lease office space, equipment and furniture from certain of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries. These properties are utilized by the Companys directors, officers and staff in the conduct of the business. The properties of the Companys Regulated Businesses consist mainly of approximately:  80 surface water treatment plants;  540 groundwater treatment plants;  175 wastewater treatment plants;  53,700 miles of transmission, distribution and collection mains and pipes;  1,200 groundwater wells;  1,700 water and wastewater pumping stations;  1,100 treated water storage facilities; and  74 dams. The Company has ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which its Regulated Businesses operate. These programs consist of both the rehabilitation of existing mains and equipment, and the replacement of mains and equipment that have been damaged or have reached, or are near, the end of their useful service lives. The properties within Other consist mainly of office furniture and IT equipment. Approximately 50% of all properties that the Company owns are located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Company maintains property insurance against loss or damage to its properties by fire or other perils, subject to certain exceptions. For insured losses, the Company is self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Company believes that its properties are generally maintained in good operating condition and in accordance with current standards of good water and wastewater industry practice. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Set forth below is information related to the Companys material pending legal proceedings as of February 14, 2024, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, required to be disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information below should be read together with Note 16Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with the SECs disclosure rules, the Company has elected to disclose environmental proceedings involving the Company and a governmental authority if the amount of potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, that the Company reasonably believes will result from such proceeding is $1 million or more . 39 Table of Contents Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. See Item 1BusinessRegulated BusinessesWater Supply and Wastewater Services and Item 1ARisk Factors. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as required by the 1995 Order issued by the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving a deadline of December 31, 2021, for Cal Ams compliance with the 2009 Order. The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC) issued a decision directing modifications in Cal Ams tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018, the MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCBs written interpretation. In May 2018, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The SWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMDs resolution or the SWRCBs written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against Cal Am. Following issuance by the Coastal Commission in November 2022, of a coastal development permit, as described below, Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to obtain the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Cal Am has complied with the diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2024, and future years may be impacted by a number of factors, including without limitation potential recurrence of drought conditions in California and the reduction or exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order in the future may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order. Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project Cal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred $50 million in associated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria. In 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUCs requirements for a CPCN and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUCs 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Ams cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Ams actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Ams prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $241 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2023, related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $72 million in AFUDC. 40 Table of Contents In September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Ams purchase of additional water from an expansion to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the GWR Project expansion is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, and in November 2021, Cal Am filed an application with the CPUC that sought review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am also requested rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totaling approximately $81 million. This requested amount was in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of cost recovery for facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement, which was approved by the CPUC in its unanimous 2016 final decision. On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorizes Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed facilities at approximately $62 million. Cal Am may seek recovery of amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally, the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Ams actual weighted average cost of debt for most of the facilities. On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUCs December 5, 2022 final decision. On March 30, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision denying Cal Ams application for rehearing but adopting its proposed AFUDC for already incurred and future costs. The decision also provides Cal Am the opportunity to serve supplemental testimony to increase its cost cap for certain of the Water Supply Projects extraction wells. The amended water purchase agreement and a memorandum of understanding to negotiate certain milestones related to the expansion of the GWR Project have been signed by the relevant parties. Further hearings were scheduled in a Phase 2 to this CPUC proceeding to focus on updated supply and demand estimates for the Water Supply Project, and Phase 2 testimony was completed in September 2022. On October 23, 2023, a status conference was held to determine procedural steps to conclude the proceeding. Further evidentiary hearings in this proceeding have been scheduled for March 2024. While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as relevant final decisions of the CPUC related thereto, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $112 million in aggregate construction costs, plus applicable AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 and December 2022 final decisions, as amended by its March 30, 2023 rehearing decision. See Note 16Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Coastal Development Permit Application In 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the Marina Application) to the City of Marina (the City) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the Citys coastal zone. Members of the Citys Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the Citys code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the Original Jurisdiction Application) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staffs environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the Original Jurisdiction Application did not impact Cal Ams appeal of the Citys denial of the Marina Application, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application. In October 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to 6.4 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to 4.8 million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about 2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community. In November 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. Cal Am continues to seek the remaining permits necessary to construct the Water Supply Project. 41 Table of Contents In December 2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (MCWD), MCWDs groundwater sustainability agency (GSA), and the MPWMD jointly filed a petition for writ of mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of the MPWSP slant wells. Cal Am is named as a real party in interest. On November 14, 2023, the court set an initial trial date of May 1, 2024. This matter remains pending. Subject to the impact or resolution of this litigation, construction of the desalination plant is expected to begin in 2025 and the desalination plant is estimated to be in-service by the end of 2027. Desalination Plant Development Permit The proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California, on a site owned by CEMEX, Inc. (CEMEX), and requires a combined development permit from Monterey County prior to commencement of construction. In April 2019, Monterey Countys Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. In July 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a public advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. In August 2019, MCWD filed a petition in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey Countys approval of Cal Ams combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal Am from commencing construction of the desalination plant. In October 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWDs motion for a preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of Monterey Countys approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant, but allowing Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plants construction. In January 2021, the court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part MCWDs petition. The court found that Monterey County did not completely comply with all of the requirements necessary to approve the combined development permit and set aside its approval so that Monterey County could come into compliance. The court denied all of MCWDs other claims. The court also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site. In May 2021, Cal Am filed a notice of appeal as to the Monterey County Superior Courts January 2021 decision, seeking to challenge the courts decision on Monterey Countys statement of overriding considerations. Monterey County filed a notice of appeal as to the same issue in May 2021. In June 2021, MCWD filed cross-appeals on its claims that had been denied by the court. On September 8, 2023, the court of appeal issued its opinion reversing the trial courts determination in favor of MCWD as to the statement of overriding considerations and rejecting MCWDs appeals on all of its claims that the Monterey County Superior Court had denied. On September 25, 2023, MCWD filed a petition for rehearing in the court of appeal, which was denied on October 4, 2023. On November 13, 2023, MCWD filed a petition for review in the California Supreme Court, which was denied on January 10, 2024. Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells In August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matter for consideration on the Planning Commissions agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Ams planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to the Citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the Coastal Commission. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Council consider approving the amendments. In December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes, but the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the Citys December 2018 meeting. The changes to the local coastal plan would need to be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval; however, the Coastal Commissions November 2022 approval of Cal Ams coastal development permit application has rendered moot the impact of these proposed local coastal program and zoning changes on the issuance of the coastal development permit. Test Slant Well Permitting A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay. In November 2014, the Coastal Commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Ams coastal development permits. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28, 2025. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as amended, expires on December 16, 2027. 42 Table of Contents Water Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use In July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Ams existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record. A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to the property and to construct, operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells. In November 2019, the City notified CEMEX that, based on this permanent easement and Cal Ams proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (to which Cal Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Ams extraction is limited to 500 acre-feet per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am is void. CEMEX has denied the Citys claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal Am and CEMEX believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Ams right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by Cal Ams customers. In May 2020, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court, naming Cal Am and CEMEX as defendants, and MCWRA and MCWD as real parties in interest. The lawsuit, as amended, alleges a claim for breach of contract against CEMEX and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by Cal Ams slant wells at the CEMEX site in excess of 500 acre-feet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin. In November 2020, Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA filed demurrers, which were overruled by the court at a hearing held in February 2021. In August 2020, MCWD filed a cross-complaint in the May 2020 lawsuit against Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, alleging claims for specific performance of certain provisions of the 1996 annexation agreement related to the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, as well as claims of water rights, nuisance and unreasonable water use, and seeking additional declaratory relief. Following various rulings on demurrers filed by Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, in February 2021, the court sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer to MCWDs nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers. In October 2021, the court granted a motion filed by Cal Am related to MCWDs cross-complaint, which motion requested a referral of certain issues related to MCWDs water rights and unreasonable use claims to the SWRCB for its expert advisory opinion. The SWRCB held hearings in 2022 and 2023, on the referred issues before its Administrative Hearing Officer. The Monterey County Superior Court has set a trial date of July 15, 2024, for the Citys lawsuit. Challenges Related to Compliance with Californias Sustainable Groundwater Management Act Under Californias Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) enacted in 2015, groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a GSA by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) designed to achieve sustainability by 2040. Under the SGMA, GSAs have broad powers to achieve sustainability including, but not limited to, regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting or suspending extractions from wells. The 400-acre CEMEX site overlies a small portion of the 180/400 Subbasin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin; the 84,000-acre 180/400 Subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin. In late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (the SVBGSA) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap with the SVBGSAs filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (SDWR) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not accept the GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the County of Monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap, which is permitted under SGMA. SDWR accepted Monterey Countys filing in December 2019, and now lists Monterey County as the exclusive GSA for the site. 43 Table of Contents In December 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey Countys filing, and SDWRs acceptance of the filing, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate Monterey Countys filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve the Citys status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which was granted. Monterey County filed cross-claims against the City and SDWR. In September 2020, Cal Am filed a separate but related complaint in Monterey County Superior Court challenging the validity of actions taken by the City and its GSA in adopting a groundwater sustainability plan for the CEMEX site, and the validity of the provisions of such plan. Due to the overlap of issues in the Citys lawsuit with those in the validation action, the parties stipulated to a stay of the validation action pending determination of the claims in the Citys action, which was approved by the court in December 2020. In February 2021, the City filed a separate but related in rem reverse validation complaint challenging the adoption by Monterey County of a GSP for the CEMEX site. On May 3, 2023, the City filed a second reverse validation complaint, challenging the adoption of amendments to the GSP for the 180/400 subbasin. After a hearing, in August 2021, the court denied the claims brought by the City and granted Monterey Countys cross-claims, finding that the Citys GSA notice was untimely, the Monterey County GSA was the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site, and the SVBGSAs GSP was properly adopted for the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site. In November 2021, the City appealed this decision, and in December 2021, Monterey County appealed the courts decision as to the finding that the Citys action creating a GSA was not void. The related validation and reverse validation actions remain stayed during the pendency of the appeal. On November 13, 2023, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's decision. On December 22, 2023, the City filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court. Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets  Potential Condemnation Local Agency Formation Commission Litigation In November 2018, voters in Monterey, California passed Measure J, which decided that the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of Cal Ams Monterey system assets, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. In 2020, the MPWMD certified a final environmental impact report, analyzing the environmental impacts of the MPWMDs project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. In February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (LAFCO) seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMDs boundaries. In June 2021, LAFCOs commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. In December 2021, LAFCOs commissioners denied the MPWMDs application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. In April 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its decision to deny the MPWMDs application seeking approval to become a retail water provider. In June 2022, the court granted, with conditions, a motion by Cal Am to intervene in the MPWMDs lawsuit against LAFCO. In December 2022, the court sustained in part, and denied in part, demurrers that had been filed by LAFCO seeking to dismiss the MPWMDs lawsuit. On December 11, 2023, the Monterey County Superior Court issued a writ of mandate directing LAFCO to vacate and set aside its original denial of the MPWMDs application to serve as a retail water provider (in conjunction with its effort to acquire the Monterey water system assets) and allowing the MPWMD to seek further LAFCO review of its application in compliance with all applicable law. The court held that LAFCO incorrectly applied two statutory standards and noted a lack of sufficient evidence to support certain of LAFCOs factual findings. As a result, the LAFCO denial has been nullified and LAFCO will be required to hold another hearing on the MPWMDs application. On February 8, 2024, and February 9, 2024, each of Cal Am and LAFCO, respectively, filed a notice of appeal with the California Court of Appeals regarding the Monterey County Superior Courts decision to issue the writ of mandate. Cal Am is evaluating potential additional actions to contest the writ of mandate and to seek to uphold LAFCOs denial of the MPWMDs application, including filing other challenges and/or making suitable presentations at a subsequent LAFCO rehearing. 44 Table of Contents Potential Condemnation Actions by MPWMD Separate from the proceedings related to the MPWMDs application with LAFCO, by letter dated October 3, 2022, the MPWMD notified Cal Am of a decision to appraise the Monterey system assets and requesting access to a number of Cal Ams properties and documents to assist the MPWMD with such an appraisal. Cal Am responded by letter on October 24, 2022, denying the request for access, stating that the MPWMD does not have the right to appraise Cal Ams system without LAFCO approval to become a retail water provider. On April 28, 2023, Cal Am rejected an offer by the MPWMD to purchase the Monterey system assets for $448.8 million. Over the written and oral objections of Cal Am, at a hearing held on October 10, 2023, the MPWMD adopted a resolution of necessity to authorize it to file an eminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterey system assets. On December 15, 2023, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court seeking to condemn the Monterey system assets. While the Company cannot currently predict the outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes that, given existing legal precedent related to similar attempts by public agencies in California to take over water systems and its other defenses, Cal Am should be able to defend itself successfully against the MPWMDs eminent domain lawsuit. Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by West Virginia-American Water Company, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary (WVAWC). The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015, to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored on July 1, 2015, to all customers affected by this event. On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWCs facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage. In February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Courts order certifying the issues class. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. In July 2022, the Circuit Court entered an order again certifying a class to address at trial certain liability issues but not to consider damages. In August 2022, WVAWC filed another Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia Circuit Courts July 2022 order, which petition was denied on June 8, 2023. On August 21, 2023, the Circuit Court set a date of September 9, 2024, for a class trial on issues relating to duty and breach of that duty. The trial will not find class-wide or punitive damages. The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. Chattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation On September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary (TAWC), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019. 45 Table of Contents On September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and Service Company (collectively, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the Tennessee Plaintiffs). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. On January 12, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs motion for class certification. On February 9, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed under Tennessee law. On September 21, 2023, the court upheld its prior ruling but gave the Tennessee Plaintiffs the option to file an amended class definition. On October 12, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs filed an amended class definition seeking certification of a business customer-only class. On December 1, 2023, TAWC filed a memorandum in opposition to the amended class definition. On January 18, 2024, the court heard oral argument on the motions but issued no decision. The court instead requested additional briefing and a second oral argument, deadlines for which have not yet been set. TAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. Mountaineer Gas Company Main Break During the afternoon of November 10, 2023, WVAWC was informed that an 8-inch ductile iron water main owned by WVAWC, located on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia and originally installed in approximately 1989, experienced a leak. In the early morning hours of November 11, 2023, WVAWC crews successfully completed a repair to the water main. A precautionary boil water advisory was issued the same day to approximately 300 WVAWC customers and ultimately lifted on November 12, 2023. On November 10, 2023, a break was reported in a low-pressure natural gas main located near the affected WVAWC water main break, and an inflow of water into the natural gas main and associated delivery pipelines occurred. The natural gas main and pipelines are owned by Mountaineer Gas Company, a regulated natural gas distribution company serving over 220,000 customers in West Virginia (Mountaineer Gas). The resulting inflow of water into the natural gas main and related pipelines resulted in a loss of natural gas service to approximately 1,100 Mountaineer Gas customers, as well as water entering customer service lines and certain natural gas appliances owned or used by some of the affected Mountaineer Gas customers. Mountaineer Gas reported that restoration of natural gas service to all affected gas mains occurred on November 24, 2023. The timing, order and causation of both the WVAWC water main break and Mountaineer Gass main break are currently unknown and under investigation. To date, a total of four pending lawsuits have been filed against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC purportedly on behalf of customers in Charleston, West Virginia related to these incidents. On November 14, 2023, a complaint captioned Ruffin et al. v. Mountaineer Gas Company and West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of Mountaineer Gas residential and business customers and other households and businesses supplied with natural gas in Kanawha County, which lost natural gas service on November 10, 2023, as a result of these events. The complaint alleges, among other things, breach of contract by Mountaineer Gas, trespass by WVAWC, nuisance by WVAWC, violation of statutory obligations by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, and negligence by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for loss of use of natural gas, annoyance, inconvenience and lost profits, as well as punitive damages. On November 15, 2023, a complaint captioned Toliver et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all natural persons or entities who are citizens of the State of West Virginia and who are customers of WVAWC and/or Mountaineer Gas in the affected areas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass and strict liability, as well as breach of contract against Mountaineer Gas. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, annoyance and inconvenience and business losses, as well as punitive damages. 46 Table of Contents On November 16, 2023, a complaint captioned Dodson et al. v. West Virginia American Water and Mountaineer Gas Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all West Virginia citizens living between Pennsylvania Avenue south of Washington Street, and Iowa Street, who are customers of Mountaineer Gas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass, statutory code violations and unfair or deceptive business practices. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property loss and damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, mental and emotional distress, and aggravation and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages. On January 4, 2024, a fourth complaint, captioned Thomas v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company , was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County asserting similar allegations as those included in the Ruffin , Toliver and Dodson lawsuits (the first three lawsuits), with the addition of counts alleging unjust enrichment and violations of the West Virginia Human Rights Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. On November 17, 2023, the Ruffin plaintiff filed a motion to consolidate the first three lawsuits before a single judge in Kanawha County Circuit Court. That motion remains pending. On December 5, 2023, a complaint captioned Mountaineer Gas Company v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County seeking damages under theories of trespass, negligence and implied indemnity. The damages being sought related to the incident include, among other things, repair and response costs incurred by Mountaineer Gas and attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas. On December 14, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed a motion with the Supreme Court of West Virginia to transfer this case to the West Virginia Business Court. On December 29, 2023, WVAWC filed a joinder in the motion to transfer the case. WVAWC has also filed a partial motion to dismiss this lawsuit. These motions remain pending. On December 20, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed answers to each of the first three lawsuits, which included cross-claims against WVAWC alleging that Mountaineer Gas is without fault for the claims and damages alleged in the lawsuits and WVAWC should be required to indemnify Mountaineer Gas for any damages and for attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas in the lawsuits. WVAWC has filed a partial motion to dismiss certain claims in the Ruffin, Toliver, Dodson and Thomas lawsuits and a motion to dismiss the cross-claims asserted against WVAWC therein by Mountaineer Gas. On January 30, 2024, a motion was filed with the West Virginia Supreme Court on behalf of the Toliver plaintiff to refer the four class action complaints and the Mountaineer Gas complaint to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel. On February 7, 2024, WVAWC filed a motion joining in that referral request. These motions remain pending. On December 6, 2023, WVAWC initiated a process whereby Mountaineer Gas customers could file claims with WVAWC and seek payment from WVAWC of up to $2,000 per affected household for the inconvenience arising from a loss of use of their appliances and documented out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the natural gas outage. As of January 31, 2024, a total of 412 Mountaineer Gas customers completed this claims process and were paid by WVAWC an average of approximately $1,500 each. In return, these customers were required to execute a partial release of liability in favor of WVAWC. On November 16, 2023, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (the WVPSC) issued an order initiating a general investigation into both the water main break and natural gas outages occurring in this incident to determine the cause or causes thereof, as well as breaks and outages generally throughout the systems of WVAWC and Mountaineer Gas and the utility practices of both utilities. Following a series of disagreements among the parties regarding the scope of discovery, the WVPSC closed the general investigation into both utilities and ordered a separate general investigation for each utility. The WVPSC focused the two general investigations away from the cause of the events and instead on the maintenance practices of each utility during and after the main breaks. On January 29, 2024, the Consumer Advocate Division of the WVPSC filed a motion to intervene in the WVAWC general investigation. WVAWC is cooperating with its general investigation. Both general investigations remain pending. The Company and WVAWC believe that the causes of action and other claims asserted against WVAWC in the class action complaints and the lawsuit filed by Mountaineer Gas are without merit and that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to such claims, and WVAWC is defending itself vigorously in these litigation proceedings. Given the current stage of these proceedings and the general investigation, the Company and WVAWC are currently unable to predict the outcome of any of the proceedings described above.

In August 2023, a potential class action settlement involving defendants The Chemours Company, Corteva, Inc. and DuPont de Nemours, Inc. to resolve claims brought in the MDL against them by public water systems, and a similar class action settlement with defendant 3M Company, received preliminary approval from the MDL court. The Companys utility subsidiaries have determined to remain parties to these class action settlements. On February 8, 2024, after a hearing on December 14, 2023, the MDL court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement, and the Company will begin the process of perfecting its claims under this settlement within the time period to be provided by the MDL court. A fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2, 2024. This matter remains pending. Other Matters In April 2021, American Water Resources, LLC (AWR), which, prior to the December 2021 sale of the Companys former Homeowner Services Group business (HOS) was one of the indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries comprising that business, received a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York (the EDNY). The subpoena sought documents regarding AWRs operations and its contractor network in the New York City metropolitan area. In September 2022, a former employee of AWR pled guilty in U.S. District Court to two felony counts in connection with the matters under investigation by the EDNY. The Company fully cooperated with the EDNY investigation. There are currently no pending requests from the EDNY for additional information and the Company has not been contacted by the EDNY about the investigation since July 2023. While the EDNY has not formally communicated that its investigation is complete, the Company does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. General Periodically, the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings described in this Item 3Legal Proceedings, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial position or results of operations. However, litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 48 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5.

See Item 1Business for additional information. Selected Financial Data This selected financial data below should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the remainder of this Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Statement of Operations data: Operating revenues $ 4,234 $ 3,792 $ 3,930 $ 3,777 $ 3,610 Net income attributable to common shareholders 944 820 1,263 709 621 Net income attributable to common shareholders per basic common share 4.90 4.51 6.96 3.91 3.44 Net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted common share 4.90 4.51 6.95 3.91 3.43 Balance Sheet data: Total assets $ 30,298 $ 27,787 $ 26,075 $ 24,766 $ 22,682 Long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 11,718 10,929 10,344 9,333 8,644 Other data: Cash dividends declared per common share $ 2.83 $ 2.62 $ 2.41 $ 2.20 $ 2.00 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,874 1,108 1,441 1,426 1,383 Net cash used in investing activities (2,815) (2,127) (1,536) (2,061) (1,945) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,188 1,000 (345) 1,120 494 Capital expenditures included in net cash used in investing activities (2,575) (2,297) (1,764) (1,822) (1,654) 50 Table of Contents Financial Results For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $4.90, $4.51 and $6.95, respectively. In 2023, as compared to 2022, diluted earnings per share increased $0.39. The increase was primarily driven by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses for the return on and recovery of capital and acquisition investments, offset somewhat by increased operating costs, primarily production costs from inflationary pressures, and higher pension costs. Results for 2023 reflect the net favorable impact of warmer, drier weather compared to normal, estimated at $0.13 per share, while results for 2022 reflect the net favorable impact of weather compared to normal, estimated at $0.06 per share. Results for 2023 also reflect the impact of share dilution from the equity financing of $0.29 per share, roughly equivalent to avoided interest expense on the year. Growth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions The Company continues to grow its businesses, with the substantial majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Companys infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Companys services to new customers. In 2023, the Company invested $2.7 billion, in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below: Regulated Businesses Growth and Optimization  $2.6 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the substantial majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and  $81 million to fund acquisitions, including deposits for pending acquisitions, in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 18,100 customers during 2023, in addition to approximately 18,800 customers added through organic growth during 2023. This includes the Companys New Jersey subsidiarys acquisition of the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City on June 1, 2023, for a cash purchase price of $22 million, $2 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in March 2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement. On April 6, 2023, the Companys Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment plant from Granite City for an amended purchase price of $86 million. This plant provides wastewater service for approximately 26,000 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the first quarter of 2024. Effective March 24, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the rights to buy the wastewater system assets of the Township of Towamencin, for an aggregate purchase price of $104 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater services to approximately 6,300 customer connections in seven townships in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Company expects to close this acquisition in late 2024 or early 2025, pending final regulatory approval. On October 11, 2022, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the public wastewater collection and treatment system assets (the System Assets) from the Butler Area Sewer Authority. On November 9, 2023, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the PaPUC) approved a settlement agreement without modification with respect to the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiarys application to acquire the System Assets from the Butler Area Sewer Authority for a purchase price of $230 million, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater service for approximately 15,000 customer connections. On December 14, 2023, Center Township and Summit Township filed appeals with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court seeking to reverse the order entered by the PaPUC approving the sale of the System Assets. On December 29, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed applications with the Commonwealth Court seeking to dismiss the appeals and requesting expedited consideration. By order dated February 1, 2024, the Commonwealth Court deferred deciding the application to dismiss the appeals and directed that the issues raised by the applications to dismiss are to be considered as part of the merits of the appeals. The order also granted expedited consideration and directed the case to be included on the next available list and established a briefing schedule. Based on the courts schedule, the Company estimates that the disposition of the appeals could occur as soon as the second quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had entered into 25 agreements with a total aggregate purchase price of $589 million for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, including the agreements discussed above, to add approximately 88,300 additional customers. The Company expects to invest between $16 billion to $17 billion over the next five years, and between $34 billion to $38 billion over the next 10 years, including $3.1 billion in 2024. The Companys expected future investments include:  capital investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses between $14.5 billion to $15 billion over the next five years, and between $30 billion to $33 billion over the next 10 years; and 51 Table of Contents  growth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Companys water and wastewater customer base of between $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next five years, and between $4 billion to $5 billion over the next 10 years. The Company estimates the expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its Regulated Businesses over the next ten years will be allocated to the following purposes: infrastructure renewal 68-70%, resiliency 9-11%, water quality, including capital expenditures for the EPA proposed regulations on PFAS 6-8%, operational efficiency, technology and innovation 5-7%, system expansion 4-6%, other 3-5%. Other Matters Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation On March 14, 2023, the EPA announced the proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for six PFAS including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX Chemicals), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS). The proposed regulations would establish legally enforceable levels for PFAS in drinking water. The EPA anticipates issuing a final rule in 2024 and utilities will be provided a three-year window to comply with the new regulations once finalized, although the Safe Drinking Water Act allows utilities to request an additional two years if capital improvements are required. The Company performed an initial review of the NPDWR to assess the four parts per trillion requirements for PFAS and the application of the Hazard Index approach for PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and GenX Chemicals. On May 24, 2023, the Company submitted comments to the EPA outlining its position on key issues to address the proposed regulations, including its projected costs associated with PFAS treatment at the proposed limits and the potential impact to customers bills. The Company estimates an investment of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities over a three to five-year period in order to comply with the proposed regulations. Additionally, the Company estimates annual operating expenses up to approximately $50 million related to testing and treatment in today's dollars. These are preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. The actual expenses may differ from these preliminary estimates and will be dependent upon multiple factors, including the final rule and effective date, as well as the completion of a system-by-system engineering analysis. The Company supports sound policies and compliance with the NPDWR by all water utilities, while protecting customers and communities from the costly burden of monitoring and mitigating PFAS contamination in water systems. The Company continues to advocate for policies that hold polluters accountable and is participating in the multi-district litigation and other lawsuits filed against certain PFAS manufacturers seeking damages and reimbursement of costs incurred and continuing to be incurred to address contamination of public water supply systems by PFAS. For more information on the PFAS multi-district litigation, see Item 3Legal ProceedingsPFAS Multi-District Litigation. Operational Excellence The Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio was 32.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (EADIT) shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs. The Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the amortization of the EADIT. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The items discussed above were excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of managements ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. 52 Table of Contents The Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Companys consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys GAAP disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Presented in the table below is the calculation of the Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, to those amounts utilized in the calculation of its adjusted O&M efficiency ratio: For the Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Total operation and maintenance expenses $ 1,720 $ 1,589 $ 1,777 Less: Operation and maintenance expensesOther 279 244 452 Total operation and maintenance expensesRegulated Businesses 1,441 1,345 1,325 Less: Regulated purchased water expenses 161 154 153 Allocation of non-operation and maintenance expenses 25 31 34 Adjusted operation and maintenance expensesRegulated Businesses (i) $ 1,255 $ 1,160 $ 1,138 Total operating revenues $ 4,234 $ 3,792 $ 3,930 Less: Operating revenuesOther 314 287 546 Total operating revenuesRegulated Businesses 3,920 3,505 3,384 Less: Regulated purchased water revenues (a) 161 154 153 Revenue reductions from the amortization of EADIT (66) (89) (104) Adjusted operating revenuesRegulated Businesses (ii) $ 3,825 $ 3,440 $ 3,335 Adjusted O&M efficiency ratioRegulated Businesses (i) / (ii) 32.8 % 33.7 % 34.1 % (a) The calculation assumes regulated purchased water revenues approximate regulated purchased water expenses. 53 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters General Rate Cases Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective during 2023: (In millions) Effective Date Amount General rate cases by state: Missouri May 28, 2023 $ 44 Virginia April 24, 2023 (a) 11 Pennsylvania January 28, 2023 138 Illinois January 1, 2023 67 California, Step Increase January 1, 2023 13 Total general rate case authorizations $ 273 (a) Interim rates were effective May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates were subject to refund. The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued its final Order on April 24, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a decision on the cost of capital application for the Companys California subsidiary, which authorized a return on equity of 8.98% and a capital structure with an equity component of 57.04% for the three-year period from 2022 to 2024. The CPUCs decision was effective from the date of the order through the end of 2024. The decision included a Water Cost of Capital Mechanism (the WCCM) that allows the California subsidiary to increase its return on equity for the remainder of 2023 and 2024 based on capital market rates. As authorized by the WCCM, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC staff advice letters to increase the return on equity. On July 25, 2023, the CPUC staff approved a return on equity of 9.50%, effective July 31, 2023. On November 15, 2023, the CPUC staff approved a return on equity of 10.20%, effective January 1, 2024. On May 3, 2023, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order approving the March 3, 2023, joint settlement agreement in the general rate case filed on July 1, 2022, by the Companys Missouri subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $44 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues, excluding $51 million in previously approved infrastructure surcharges, and authorized implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective May 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Missouri subsidiarys 2021 rate case order. The Missouri subsidiarys view of its rate base was $2.3 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) was 9.75% and 50.0%, respectively. On April 24, 2023, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order approving the settlement of the rate case filed on September 26, 2022, by the Companys Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $11 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues. Interim rates in this proceeding were effective on May 1, 2022, and the order required that the difference between interim and the final approved rates were subject to refund within 90 days of the order issuance. The order approves the settlement terms with a return on equity of 9.7% and a common equity ratio of 40.7%. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Virginia subsidiarys 2020 rate case order that have been completed or were planned through April 30, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order includes recovery of the Virginia subsidiarys COVID-19 deferral balance. It also includes approval of the accounting deferral of deviations in pension and other postretirement benefits expense from those established in base rates, until the Virginia subsidiarys next base rate case. On December 8, 2022, the PaPUC issued an order approving the joint settlement agreement in the rate case filed on April 29, 2022, by the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues, excluding $24 million for previously approved infrastructure filings, and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective January 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiarys 2021 rate case order that were completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery of the Pennsylvania subsidiarys COVID-19 deferral balance. The Pennsylvania subsidiarys view of its rate base was $5.1 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) was 10.0% and 44.8%, respectively. 54 Table of Contents On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on February 10, 2022, by the Companys Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiarys June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $18 million, effective January 1, 2023, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.78%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiarys 2017 rate case order that have been completed or were planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. Pending General Rate Case Filings On January 25, 2024, the Companys Illinois subsidiary filed tariffs for new water and wastewater rates. The request seeks a two-step rate increase consisting of aggregate annualized incremental revenue, based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75%, of (i) approximately $136 million effective January 1, 2025, based on a future test year through December 31, 2025 with average rate base and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.27% and a debt component of 47.73%, and (ii) approximately $16 million effective January 1, 2026, based on a future test year to include end of period rate base and a capital structure with an equity component of 54.43% and a debt component of 45.57%. The requested increases are driven primarily by an estimated $557 million in capital investments to be made by the Illinois subsidiary starting January 2024 through December 2025. The request also proposes a treatment and compliance rider to address recovery of future environmental compliance investments, and a modification to the existing volume balancing account mechanism to include full production cost recovery. On January 19, 2024, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $162 million in additional annualized revenues, whic h is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75% and a capital structure with an equity component of 56.30% and a debt component of 43.70%. The requested annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by approximately $1.3 billion in capital investments made and to be made by the New Jersey subsidiary through December 2024. The request also proposes a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks a deferral of certain production cost adjustments. On December 15, 2023, the Companys California subsidiary submitted a request to delay by one year its cost of capital filing and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2025. On February 2, 2024, the CPUC granted the request for a one year extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2025, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2026. On November 8, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $204 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding projected infrastructure surcharges of $20 million. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.95% and a capital structure with an equity component of 55.30% and a debt component of 44.70%. The requested annualized incremental revenue increase is driven primarily by an estimated $1.0 billion of incremental capital investments to be made through mid-2025. The request also proposes a mechanism to address compliance with evolving environmental requirements, such as emerging federal regulations for lead and PFAS. If approved, the new rates would be expected to take effect on August 7, 2024. On November 1, 2023, the Companys Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $20 million in additional annualized revenues. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.95% and a capital structure with an equity component of 45.67% and a debt and other component of 54.33%. The requested increase is driven by approximately $110 million in capital investments between May 2023 and April 2025. The request also proposed a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks deferral of certain production cost adjustments. Interim rates will be effective May 1, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On June 30, 2023, the Companys Kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $26 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharges of $10 million. The request is based on a proposed return on common equity of 10.75% and a proposed capital structure with a common equity component of 52.45%. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2024. On May 1, 2023, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $45 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding previously approved infrastructure surcharges of $7 million. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.50% and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.80%. The general rate case includes a future test year capturing planned investment through 2025 and an order is expected to be issued by February 25, 2024. On June 30, 2023, the West Virginia subsidiary filed its annual infrastructure surcharge requesting $8 million in additional annualized revenues for planned investment through 2024. The infrastructure surcharge will be aligned with the investments recognized in the general rate case if the future test year is approved. 55 Table of Contents On March 31, 2023, the Companys Indiana subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $87 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding $41 million of revenue from infrastructure filings already approved, which includes three step increases, with $43 million of the increase to be included in rates in January 2024, $18 million in May 2024, and $26 million in May 2025. The requested adjustment is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.60% and a capital structure with an equity component of 56.20%. Hearings were completed in September and an order is expected in the general rate case by the end of February 2024. On July 1, 2022, the Companys California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, all as compared to 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to capture the authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the Companys sales and associated variable expense forecast. The revised filing requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 of $37 million, compared to 2023 revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million, respectively. The total revenue requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is $76 million. On November 17, 2023, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC a partial settlement agreement reached with the CPUCs Public Advocates Office, which would determine the amount of incremental annualized water and wastewater revenue to be received by the California subsidiary to be $20 million in the 2024 test year, $16 million in the 2025 escalation year, and $15 million in the 2026 attrition year . The partial settlement agreement addresses the California subsidiarys revenue requirement request but does not address rate design or certain other matters, such as the requested inclusion and implementation of a revenue stability mechanism to separate the California subsidiarys revenue and water sales. New rates would be implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon a final decision issued by the CPUC approving the partial settlement agreement and resolving the other issues not addressed by the partial settlement agreement, which is expected to occur in mid-2024. Infrastructure Surcharges A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2023: (In millions) Effective Date Amount Infrastructure surcharges by state: New Jersey (a) $ 32 Kentucky October 1, 2023 4 Indiana (b) 26 Missouri January 16, 2023 14 Pennsylvania January 1, 2023 3 West Virginia January 1, 2023 7 Total infrastructure surcharge authorizations $ 86 (a) In 2023, $15 million was effective October 30, $1 million was effective June 29 and $16 million was effective April 29. (b) In 2023, $20 million was effective March 23 and $6 million was effective March 8. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2024: (In millions) Effective Date Amount Infrastructure surcharge filings by state: Missouri January 20, 2024 $ 26 Illinois January 1, 2024 5 Total infrastructure surcharge filings $ 31 Pending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings On January 31, 2024, the Companys Iowa subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $1 million in additional annualized revenues. 56 Table of Contents Other Regulatory Matters In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Companys California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would have become effective upon receiving an order in the current pending rate case. On October 5, 2020, the Companys California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUCs denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Companys California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiarys petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporations revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Companys California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its pending 2022 general rate case, which, if adopted, will become effective upon receiving an order in the current pending rate case. On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Companys New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfields water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJs initial decision without modification. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4, 2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively. Oral argument was held on March 22, 2023, and the decision remains pending. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPUs order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consolidated Results of Operations Presented in the table below are the Companys consolidated results of operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 4,234 $ 3,792 $ 3,930 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 1,720 1,589 1,777 Depreciation and amortization 704 649 636 General taxes 307 281 321 Other (1)   Total operating expenses, net 2,730 2,519 2,734 Operating income 1,504 1,273 1,196 Other income (expense): Interest expense (460) (433) (403) Interest Income 73 52 4 Non-operating benefit costs, net 32 77 78 Gain on sale of businesses  19 747 Other, net 47 20 18 Total other income (expense) (308) (265) 444 Income before income taxes 1,196 1,008 1,640 Provision for income taxes 252 188 377 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 944 $ 820 $ 1,263 57 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations The Companys operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. Other primarily includes MSG, which does not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Companys Regulated Businesses , i nterest income related to the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS, income from assets not associated with the Regulated Businesses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. This presentation is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. For a discussion and analysis of the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, please refer to Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2023. Sale of Homeowner Services Group On December 9, 2021, the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary (the Buyer) of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm, for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in pre-tax gain of $748 million. The consideration at closing was comprised of $480 million in cash, a secured seller promissory note payable in cash and issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, with an interest rate of 7.00% per year, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which is included in Gain on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recognized $50 million of interest income during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, from the secured seller note. On February 2, 2024, the secured seller note was amended to increase the principal amount from $720 million to $795 million, in full satisfaction of the $75 million contingent cash payment payable under the HOS sale agreement. In addition, the interest rate payable on the secured seller note has increased from 7.00% per year to 10.00% per year until maturity. The secured seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants. Certain of these covenants have been amended, including to provide for annual reductions of specified debt incurrence ratios. Furthermore, the amendment to the secured seller note eliminated the conditional right, beginning December 9, 2024, to require a repayment, without premium or penalty, of 100% of the outstanding principal amount in full in cash together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other obligations thereunder. The final maturity date of the secured seller note remains December 9, 2026. The $75 million additional principal under the secured seller note must be repaid in full, without premium or penalty, in the event a proposed acquisition of a complementary business by or on behalf of an affiliate of the Buyer is not completed by May 2, 2024. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note are secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as Market-Based Businesses and Other have been combined and shown as Other. Segment results for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. 58 Table of Contents Regulated Businesses Segment Presented in the table below is financial information for the Regulated Businesses: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 3,920 $ 3,505 $ 3,384 Operation and maintenance 1,441 1,345 1,325 Depreciation and amortization 693 633 601 General taxes 288 264 301 Other operating (income) expense (1)  1 Other income (expense) (269) (220) (195) Provision for income taxes 259 188 172 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 971 $ 854 $ 789 Operating Revenues Presented in the tables below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses operating revenues: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Water services: Residential $ 2,143 $ 1,941 $ 1,935 Commercial 798 710 676 Fire service 158 147 151 Industrial 167 153 141 Public and other 284 267 239 Total water services 3,550 3,218 3,142 Wastewater services: Residential 228 174 151 Commercial 62 45 37 Industrial 8 4 4 Public and other 29 19 16 Total wastewater services 327 242 208 Other (a) 43 45 34 Total operating revenues $ 3,920 $ 3,505 $ 3,384 (a) Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents. For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (Gallons in millions) Billed water services volumes: Residential 160,921 162,105 173,644 Commercial 78,404 77,627 77,476 Industrial 36,404 37,265 35,738 Fire service, public and other 54,236 51,966 51,957 Total billed water services volumes 329,965 328,963 338,815 59 Table of Contents In 2023, as compared to 2022, operating revenues increased $415 million, primarily due to: (i) a $350 million increase from authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund infrastructure investment in various states; (ii) a $32 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions and organic growth in existing systems; (iii) a $19 million estimated net increase primarily due to drier than normal weather in 2023, mainly driven by drought conditions in our Missouri service territory; (iv) a $23 million net increase as a result of reduced amortization of EADIT, primarily in the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary; and (v) partially offset by a $12 million decrease due to changes in customer demand. Operation and Maintenance Presented in the table below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses operating and maintenance expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Employee-related costs $ 513 $ 505 $ 522 Production costs 438 387 353 Operating supplies and services 255 242 245 Maintenance materials and supplies 102 96 93 Customer billing and accounting 65 59 66 Other 68 56 46 Total operation and maintenance expense $ 1,441 $ 1,345 $ 1,325 Employee-Related Costs For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Salaries and wages $ 413 $ 395 $ 402 Group insurance 60 59 66 Pensions 9 21 25 Other benefits 31 30 29 Total employee-related costs $ 513 $ 505 $ 522 In 2023, as compared to 2022, employee-related costs increased $8 million primarily due to annual merit increases and higher employee headcount to support growth of the business, which was partially offset by lower pension service costs, mainly attributable to an increase in the discount rate assumption. Production Costs For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Purchased water $ 161 $ 154 $ 153 Fuel and power 108 104 97 Chemicals 105 78 59 Waste disposal 64 51 44 Total production costs $ 438 $ 387 $ 353 In 2023, as compared to 2022, production costs increased $51 million, primarily due to inflationary impacts from increased fuel, power and chemical costs, as well as an increase in waste disposal maintenance. 60 Table of Contents Operating Supplies and Services In 2023, as compared to 2022, operating supplies and services increased $13 million primarily due to an increase in maintenance costs on equipment and buildings. Other In 2023, as compared to 2022, other increased $12 million primarily due to an increase to the insurance other than group reserve which had an unfavorable claims experience compared to prior year, as well as higher insurance premiums. Depreciation and Amortization In 2023, as compared to 2022, depreciation and amortization increased $60 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and acquisitions. General Taxes In 2023, as compared to 2022, general taxes increased $24 million, primarily due to an increase in the New Jersey Gross Receipts Tax and incremental property taxes. Other Income (Expense) In 2023, as compared to 2022, other expenses increased $49 million primarily due to higher net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the current period as a result of market conditions, as well as higher interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by an increase in allowance for funds used during construction in the current periods. Provision for Income Taxes In 2023, as compared to 2022, the Regulated Businesses provision for income taxes increased $71 million. The Regulated Businesses effective income tax rate was 21.1% and 18.0% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT, pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with reductions in revenue. Other Presented in the table below is information for Other: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 314 $ 287 $ 546 Operation and maintenance 279 244 452 Depreciation and amortization 11 16 35 General taxes 19 17 20 Interest expense (96) (119) (113) Interest income 45 50 3 Gain on sale of businesses  19 748 Other income 12 6 2 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (7)  205 Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders $ (27) $ (34) $ 474 Operating Revenues In 2023, as compared to 2022, operating revenues increased $27 million from an increase in capital projects in MSG, primarily at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and revenue for Naval Station Mayport. The Naval Station Mayport contract was awarded on June 30, 2022, with the performance start date for operation on March 1, 2023. 61 Table of Contents Operation and Maintenance Presented in the table below is information regarding the main components of Others operating and maintenance expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Operating supplies and services $ 150 $ 120 $ 191 Maintenance materials and supplies 29 35 123 Employee-related costs 85 73 109 Production costs 9 10 7 Other 6 6 22 Total operation and maintenance expense $ 279 $ 244 $ 452 Operating Supplies and Services In 2023, as compared to 2022, operating supplies and services increased $30 million primarily due to costs associated with the increased capital projects in MSG. Employee-Related Costs In 2023, as compared to 2022, employee-related costs increased $12 million primarily due to salaries and wages and group insurance. Gain on Sale of Businesses In 2022, the Company recorded post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which increased the total gain related to the sale of HOS. See Note 5Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Tax Matters On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) was signed into law. The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the companys average adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable corporation must make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. During 2023, the Company evaluated the potential impacts of the CAMT provision within the IRA and available guidance and determined that it did not exceed the $1 billion AFSI threshold and therefore was not subject to CAMT in 2023. Based on current guidance, the Company is expected to be subject to CAMT beginning in 2024, and will continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance is released. Legislative Updates During 2023 and 2024, the Companys regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 14, 2024:  California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporations revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and was effective on January 1, 2023.  Indiana passed House Bill 1417, which allows for deferred accounting and subsequent recovery through rates of regulatory assets, with or without Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the IURC) approval. There are several requirements: (i) the costs must be deferred as a regulatory asset, (ii) only incremental costs may be deferred, and (iii) the IURC must find the costs to be reasonable and prudent. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on April 20, 2023.  Indiana passed Senate Bill 180, which allows for consolidated revenue to support post-acquisition capital improvements in wastewater systems via a service enhancement improvement recovery mechanism. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on May 1, 2023. 62 Table of Contents  Illinois passed House Bill 1105, which provides that property belonging to a public utility that provides water or sewer service may not be taken or damaged by eminent domain without prior approval from the Illinois Commerce Commission. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on June 9, 2023.  Illinois passed Senate Bill 250 (Public Act 103-0006), which contains supplemental appropriations for the previous fiscal year 2023 and appropriations for fiscal year 2024. This bill contains a $5 million appropriation to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for purposes of grants pursuant to the Water and Sewer Financial Assistance Act (Public Act 102-262), which was an initiative of the Companys Illinois subsidiary during the 102nd General Assembly. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 7, 2023, and the appropriation became effective July 1, 2023.  California passed Senate Bill 122, which authorizes $300 million in additional funding for the California Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program, and extends the eligibility date from March 2020 to June 2021, to March 2020 to December 2022. Legislation was signed and became effective on July 10, 2023.  California passed Senate Bill 253, which requires any public or private company that does business in California and has over $1 billion in annual revenue to publicly disclose, beginning in 2026, scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions released from their operations and supply chain.  California passed Senate Bill 261, which requires companies doing business in California with greater than $500 million in annual revenues to prepare, beginning in 2026, biennial reports disclosing climate-related financial risk.  New Jersey passed Assembly Bill 4791, establishing the "Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge Program," which creates a regulatory mechanism that enables water and wastewater utilities to recover the costs of investment in certain non-revenue producing utility system components that enhance water and wastewater system resiliency, environmental compliance such as existing and proposed requirements for PFAS, safety, and public health. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on January 12, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1BusinessRegulated BusinessesRegulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity issuances, in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of payments under a secured seller promissory note, plus interest. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time. The Company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. The Companys business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. The Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings, and may also access the equity capital markets as needed or desired to support capital funding requirements. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, American Water Capital Corp. (AWCC), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Companys access to external financing on reasonable terms may depend on, as appropriate, any or all of the following: current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general; conditions in the debt or equity capital markets; the Companys credit ratings; and conditions in the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Companys ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. 63 Table of Contents If these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility. The Companys revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. AWCCs revolving credit facility is used principally to support its commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sub-limit for the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. The maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized for issuance under AWCCs commercial paper program is $2.60 billion. On October 26, 2023, the termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCCs revolving credit facility was extended, as permitted by the terms of the credit agreement, from October 2027 to October 2028. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods, as to which one such extension request remains. As of December 31, 2023, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $75 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $2.50 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Companys short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. The Companys future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes, and overall economic conditions. The Companys current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. The Company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms. Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from operating activities: For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net income $ 944 $ 820 $ 1,263 Add (less): Depreciation and amortization 704 649 636 Deferred income taxes and amortization of investment tax credits 208 80 230 Other non-cash activities (a) (9) (16) (27) Changes in working capital (b) 76 (355) 126 Pension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions (49) (51) (40) Gain on sale of businesses  (19) (747) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,874 $ 1,108 $ 1,441 (a) Includes provision for losses on accounts receivable, pension and non-pension postretirement benefits and other non-cash, net. Details of each component can be found on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (b) Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued taxes and other current assets and liabilities, net. Details of each component can be found on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2023, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $766 million, primarily due to changes in deferred taxes, working capital and an increase in net income. The change in deferred taxes was driven by the settlement of the deferred tax liability in 2022 related to the Companys New York regulated operations that was sold in the first quarter of 2022. The changes in working capital were primarily driven by $280 million of estimated tax payments for taxable gains on the sales of the Companys Homeowner Services Group and its New York regulated operations in the first half of 2022. 64 Table of Contents The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $44 million in 2024. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from investing activities: For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 2021 Capital expenditures $ (2,575) $ (2,297) $ (1,764) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (81) (315) (135) Proceeds from sale of assets, net of cash on hand  608 472 Removal costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net (159) (123) (109) Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,815) $ (2,127) $ (1,536) In 2023, cash flows used in investing activities increased $688 million as a result of increased payments for capital expenditures, as well as no assets sales in 2023 whereas 2022 had $608 million of proceeds from the sale of the Companys New York operations. The Company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the Companys Regulated Businesses, as discussed below. The Companys infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces mains, services, meters, hydrants and valves, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. The Companys projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. Presented in the table below is a summary of the Companys capital expenditures by category: For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2023 2022 2021 Transmission and distribution $ 922 $ 901 $ 749 Treatment and pumping 322 190 197 Services, meter and fire hydrants 652 546 366 General structure and equipment 333 380 251 Sources of supply 88 95 64 Wastewater 258 185 137 Total capital expenditures $ 2,575 $ 2,297 $ 1,764 In 2023, the Companys capital expenditures increased $278 million due to an increase across most infrastructure categories. The Company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the Companys existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2023, the Company paid $81 million to fund acquisitions, including deposits for pending acquisitions. The Company closed on 23 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems during 2023, which added approximately 18,100 water and wastewater customers. As previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $16 billion to $17 billion, with $14.5 billion to $15 billion for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and the Company expects to invest between $34 billion to $38 billion over the next 10 years. In 2024, the Company expects to invest $3.1 billion, consisting of infrastructure improvements and acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses. 65 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from financing activities: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Proceeds from long-term debt $ 1,264 $ 822 $ 1,118 Repayments of long-term debt (282) (15) (372) (Repayments of) proceeds from term loan   (500) Net proceeds from common stock financing 1,688   Net short-term (repayments) borrowings with maturities less than three months (996) 591 (198) Dividends paid (532) (467) (428) Other financing activities, net (a) 46 69 35 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,188 $ 1,000 $ (345) (a) Includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, net of taxes paid, advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption. In 2023, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $188 million, primarily due to the common stock financing and issuance of long-term debt. This was partially offset by repayment in full of the short-term commercial paper obligations during the first half of 2023. The Companys financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and equity issuances from parent company. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent companys borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2023, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $7.6 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans to parent company amounting to $3.4 billion. On March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of parent company common stock. Upon closing of this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1,688 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of AWCC, the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, and for general corporate purposes. On June 29, 2023, AWCC issued, in a private placement, $1,035 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes). AWCC received net proceeds of approximately $1,022 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCCs commercial paper obligations and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. See Note 11Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts (through AWCC) for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of A or better. 66 Table of Contents In November and December 2023, the Company entered into six treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $225 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2024. These treasury lock agreements terminate in September 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 4.24%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt. During 2022 and the first half of 2023, the Company entered into 11 treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $300 million. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In June 2023, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a net gain of $3 million included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. In February 2021, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in February 2024. During 2022 and 2021, $800 million, and $1.10 billion, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this registration statement. During 2023 under this registration statement, parent company issued 12,650,000 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,688 million. Presented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2023: Company Type Rate Weighted Average Rate Maturity Amount (in millions) AWCC (a) Senior notesfixed rate 3.63% 3.63% 2026 $ 1,035 AWCC (a) Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 3.70%-3.88% 3.80% 2028 86 Other American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 0.00%-3.75% 2.88% 2025-2041 143 Total issuances $ 1,264 (a) This indebtedness is considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under such indebtedness. See Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes below. Presented in the table below are the retirements and redemptions of long-term debt in 2023 through sinking fund provisions, optional redemption or payment at maturity: Company Type Rate Weighted Average Rate Maturity Amount (in millions) AWCC Senior notesfixed rate 6.55% 6.55% 2023 $ 14 AWCC Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 0.60%-2.31% 0.68% 2023-2031 87 Other American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 0.00%-5.50% 1.20% 2023-2051 163 Other American Water subsidiaries Mortgage bondsfixed rate 6.76%-6.96% 6.84% 2023 18 Total retirements and redemptions $ 282 From time to time and as market conditions warrant, the Company may engage in long-term debt retirements through make-whole redemptions, tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable alternatives. 67 Table of Contents Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes Outstanding unsecured senior notes issued by AWCC (other than the Notes) have been issued under two indentures, each by and between AWCC and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder. The Notes were issued under an indenture, by and among AWCC, parent company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the Notes. The senior notes and the Notes have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under such indebtedness. No other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of such indebtedness. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes or the Notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder thereof, funds to make such payment in full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any such holder, when due, the support agreement provides that such holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder. As a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCCs ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes and the Notes will be dependent upon AWCCs receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes and the Notes. Because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent companys ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries. See Note 9Shareholders EquityDividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent companys operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or the Notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent companys obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent companys subsidiaries other than AWCC. Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt Interest rates on advances under the AWCC revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Services and S&P Global Ratings then applicable credit rating on AWCCs senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCCs commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCCs commercial paper are considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations thereunder. Presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31: 2023 Commercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a) (In millions) Total availability $ 2,600 $ 150 $ 2,750 Outstanding debt (180) (75) (255) Remaining availability as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,420 $ 75 $ 2,495 (a) Total remaining availability of $2.50 billion as of December 31, 2023, was accessible through revolver draws. 68 Table of Contents 2022 Commercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a) (In millions) Total availability $ 2,600 $ 150 $ 2,750 Outstanding debt (1,177) (78) (1,255) Remaining availability as of December 31, 2022 $ 1,423 $ 72 $ 1,495 (a) Total remaining availability of $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2022, was accessible through revolver draws. Presented in the table below is the Companys total available liquidity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: Cash and Cash Equivalents Availability on Revolving Credit Facility Total Available Liquidity (In millions) Available liquidity as of December 31, 2023 $ 330 $ 2,495 $ 2,825 Available liquidity as of December 31, 2022 $ 85 $ 1,495 $ 1,580 The weighted average interest rate on AWCCs outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 5.51% and 4.41%, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital Structure Presented in the table below is the percentage of the Companys capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Total common shareholders equity 44.2 % 38.3 % 39.9 % Long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 52.9 % 54.4 % 56.6 % Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 2.9 % 7.3 % 3.5 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The change in the capital structure mix in 2023 is mainly attributable to the common stock issuance on March 3, 2023, and the long-term debt issuance on June 29, 2023. The proceeds from these issuances were used to repay short-term commercial paper borrowings. Debt Covenants The Companys debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Companys assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations. Covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2023, the Companys ratio was 0.56 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants. 69 Table of Contents Security Ratings Presented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of February 14, 2024, as issued by Moodys Investors Service on January 29, 2024, and S&P Global Ratings on February 6, 2023: Securities Moodys Investors Service S&P Global Ratings Rating outlook Stable Stable Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A Commercial paper P-2 A-1 A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. The Company does not have any material borrowings that are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility. As part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Companys securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt. Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions For discussion of the Companys dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 9Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Insurance Coverage The Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and develop estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Companys Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Regulation and Regulatory Accounting The Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria. Application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Companys financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. For each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Companys regulatory asset balance was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and its regulatory liability balance was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. See Note 3Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Companys significant regulatory assets and liabilities. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods. Under GAAP, specifically ASC 740, Income Taxes , the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. For the Companys regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. For the Companys unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings. 71 Table of Contents Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 14Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations. The Company also maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. See Note 2Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans. The Companys pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Companys pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions are:  Discount RateThe discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.  Expected Return on Plan Assets (EROA)Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Company records currently.  Rate of Compensation IncreaseManagement projects employees pay increases, which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement.  Health Care Cost Trend RateManagement projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.  Mortality Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012. The discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans expected cash flows by matching the plans cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.18%, 5.58% and 2.94% at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.22%, 5.60% and 2.90% at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.79% for 2023, 6.50% for 2022 and 6.50% for 2021. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 5.00% for 2023, 3.60% for 2022 and 3.67% for 2021. 72 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category: 2024 Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, Asset Category 2023 2022 Equity securities 37 % 41 % 57 % Fixed income 63 % 59 % 43 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Presented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category: 2024 Target Allocation (a) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, Asset Category 2023 2022 Equity securities 27 % 32 % 30 % Fixed income 73 % 68 % 70 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (a) Refer to Note 15Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the allocations of assets and the trusts which fund the other postretirement benefit plans The investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds, commingled funds and limited partnerships. The trustee for the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Companys rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2023, 2022 and 2021. In selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2023 , the Companys health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic benefit cost was 7.00% in 2023 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2023, the Company projects that medical inflation will be 6.75% in 2024 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter. The Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.18% and 6.79%, respectively, for estimating its 2024 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.22% and 5.00%, respectively, for estimating its 2024 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Companys pension expense. The Companys 2023 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $6 million and the 2022 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $47 million. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $44 million in 2024; however, the actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. Benefit Plan Amendments In December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (AWPP), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as of December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants (AWPP Inactive). Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. Actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive are amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. The actuarial gains and losses associated with the AWPP continued to be amortized over the average remaining service period for active participants. The Company remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets to reflect the amendment for each plan as of December 31, 2022. 73 Table of Contents In December 2022, the Company completed plan amendments to spin-off and merge a portion of the American Water Retiree Welfare Plan, with and into the Companys medical plan for active employees (Active Medical Plan), in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (Bargained VEBA) trust. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of these changes, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of Active Medical Plan participants (Active VEBA). The transfer of these Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $194 million of assets, as of December 31, 2022, for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. The Company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as permitted by accounting guidance. See Note 18Fair Value of Financial Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on accounting for the assets as investments in debt and equity securities. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the Companys Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customers actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. Increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Companys regulated utilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $193 million and $178 million, respectively. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process. The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue within Other as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $109 million and $97 million, respectively. Revenue from the Companys former HOS business, which was sold in December 2021, was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied. 74 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies The Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on managements judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range. Actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies. Recent Accounting Standards See Note 2Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with the Companys short-term borrowings would result in a $3 million increase in short-term interest expense. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had six treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $225 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2024. These treasury lock agreements terminate in September 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 4.24%. When entering into treasury locks, the Company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the treasury locks. The Company manages market risk by matching the terms of the treasury locks with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance. The fair value of the treasury locks at December 31, 2023, was in a loss position of $8 million. A hypothetical 1% adverse change in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the treasury locks to a loss position of approximately $26 million at December 31, 2023. The Companys risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The market price of the Companys common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, the Companys stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations. 75 Table of Contents The Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and related services. The Companys Regulated Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the businesses within Other engage in business activities with government entities and other customers. The Companys primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Companys credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. The Companys credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. In addition, the Regulated Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates. The Companys retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the Companys pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, the Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates. The Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates. The credit quality of the Companys customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In addition, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. Therefore, the Companys ability to fully recover operating expense, recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted. 76 Table

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 78 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Accounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,119 million and $1,482 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders ( including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to managements judgments. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Companys regulatory accounting process, including controls over managements assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of managements judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Companys correspondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory asset and liability balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Companys regulators. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 14, 2024 We have served as the Companys auditor since 1948. 79 Table of Contents American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies Consolidated Balance Sheets (In millions, except share and per share data) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 ASSETS Property, plant and equipment $ 32,189 $ 29,736 Accumulated depreciation ( 6,751 ) ( 6,513 ) Property, plant and equipment, net 25,438 23,223 Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 330 85 Restricted funds 34 32 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $ 51 and $ 60 , respectively 339 334 Income tax receivable 86 114 Unbilled revenues 302 275 Materials and supplies 112 98 Other 186 312 Total current assets 1,389 1,250 Regulatory and other long-term assets: Regulatory assets 1,106 990 Seller promissory note from the sale of the Homeowner Services Group 720 720 Operating lease right-of-use assets 86 82 Goodwill 1,143 1,143 Other 416 379 Total regulatory and other long-term assets 3,471 3,314 Total assets $ 30,298 $ 27,787 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 80 Table of Contents American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies Consolidated Balance Sheets (In millions, except share and per share data) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 CAPITALIZATION AND LIABILITIES Capitalization: Common stock ($ 0.01 par value; 500,000,000 shares authorized; 200,144,968 and 187,200,539 shares issued, respectively) $ 2 $ 2 Paid-in-capital 8,550 6,824 Retained earnings 1,659 1,267 Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 26 ) ( 23 ) Treasury stock, at cost ( 5,414,867 and 5,342,477 shares, respectively) ( 388 ) ( 377 ) Total common shareholders' equity 9,797 7,693 Long-term debt 11,715 10,926 Redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 3 3 Total long-term debt 11,718 10,929 Total capitalization 21,515 18,622 Current liabilities: Short-term debt 179 1,175 Current portion of long-term debt 475 281 Accounts payable 294 254 Accrued liabilities 791 706 Accrued taxes 67 49 Accrued interest 93 91 Other 252 255 Total current liabilities 2,151 2,811 Regulatory and other long-term liabilities: Advances for construction 352 316 Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits 2,717 2,437 Regulatory liabilities 1,481 1,590 Operating lease liabilities 73 70 Accrued pension expense 262 235 Other 196 202 Total regulatory and other long-term liabilities 5,081 4,850 Contributions in aid of construction 1,551 1,504 Commitments and contingencies (See Note 16) Total capitalization and liabilities $ 30,298 $ 27,787 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 81 Table of Contents American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies Consolidated Statements of Operations (In millions, except per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Operating revenues $ 4,234 $ 3,792 $ 3,930 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 1,720 1,589 1,777 Depreciation and amortization 704 649 636 General taxes 307 281 321 Other ( 1 )   Total operating expenses, net 2,730 2,519 2,734 Operating income 1,504 1,273 1,196 Other income (expense): Interest expense ( 460 ) ( 433 ) ( 403 ) Interest income 73 52 4 Non-operating benefit costs, net 32 77 78 Gain on sale of businesses  19 747 Other, net 47 20 18 Total other income (expense) ( 308 ) ( 265 ) 444 Income before income taxes 1,196 1,008 1,640 Provision for income taxes 252 188 377 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 944 $ 820 $ 1,263 Basic earnings per share: (a) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 4.90 $ 4.51 $ 6.96 Diluted earnings per share: (a) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 4.90 $ 4.51 $ 6.95 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 193 182 182 Diluted 193 182 182 (a) Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 85 Table of Contents American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data) Note 1: Organization and Operation American Water Works Company, Inc. (the Company or American Water) is a holding company for subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services throughout the United States. References to parent company mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Companys primary business involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 14 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the Regulated Businesses. The Company also operates other businesses that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities. These other businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within Other. Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies Regulation The Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (PUCs). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of a regulated utilitys revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 3Regulatory Matters for additional information. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining loss contingencies. The Companys critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Companys regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to O&M expense as incurred. The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Companys regulated utilities record depreciation in conformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets remaining useful lives. 86 Table of Contents Nonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Military Services Group (MSG) and for internal operations. This property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. When units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred. The costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these costs, net of amortization, amounted to $ 419 million and $ 369 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds Substantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. Restricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services under O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues Accounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are the trade accounts receivable of other businesses, primarily MSG, and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on certain construction contracts. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Allowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Companys inability to collect receivables from customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 7Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information. Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method. Seller Promissory Note The Companys secured seller promissory note is accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 310, Receivables , and is classified as held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost at the present value of consideration received for the sale of its Homeowner Services Group (HOS) business. Interest income from the secured seller promissory note is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and earned over the contractual life of the loan. Leases The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, accrued liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. 87 Table of Contents ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROU assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for certain leases. Certain lease agreements include variable rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Additionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Companys lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Companys goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Companys previous owner in 2003 and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The goodwill of Other is attributable to the MSG reporting unit. The Companys annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount rate and growth rate. The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 8Goodwill for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, primarily include property, plant and equipment. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines if long-lived assets are potentially impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value when indicators of impairment exist. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The long-lived assets of the Companys regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable. 88 Table of Contents The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction Regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $ 18 million and $ 19 million, respectively. These amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period. Advances that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Contributions in aid of construction are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds. Generally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions in aid of construction balance as a reduction to depreciation expense, producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines, some of the Companys utility subsidiaries do not amortize contributions in aid of construction, and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet indefinitely. Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $ 40 million, $ 37 million and $ 36 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue Recognition Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, and all related amendments (collectively, ASC 606), a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under ASC 606, a contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identifies the contracts with a customer; (ii) identifies the performance obligations within the contract, including whether any performance obligations are distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determines the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Companys revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billing and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year ; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component. Regulated Businesses Revenue Revenue from the Companys Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customers actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process. 89 Table of Contents Other Revenue The Company has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. See Note 4Revenue Recognition for additional information. Prior to December 9, 2021, through various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company previously provided fixed fee services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services through its former HOS business. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns. Certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse. Investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of the related assets. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14Income Taxes for additional information. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would be included in other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Allowance for other funds used during construction $ 41 $ 20 $ 27 Allowance for borrowed funds used during construction 24 14 10 Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. 90 Table of Contents All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge). The gains and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings. Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11Long-Term Debt for additional information. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees and retirees. The plan obligation and costs of providing benefits under these plans are annually measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Cumulative gains and losses that are in excess of 10 % of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active membership for the plans, with the exception of the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants (AWPP Inactive), which is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. See Note 15Employee Benefits for additional information. The Companys policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10 % due to an event that results in terminations and/or retirements. New Accounting Standards Presented in the table below are new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2023: Standard Description Date of Adoption Application Effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers The guidance requires an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, as if it had originated the contracts. The amendments in this update also provide certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. January 1, 2023 Prospective This standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures The main provisions of this standard eliminate the receivables accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Entities must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance for receivables to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Additionally, the amendments in this update require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. January 1, 2023 Prospective, with a modified retrospective option for amendments related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. This standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements Presentation and Disclosure Requirements The guidance amends GAAP disclosure and presentation requirements for various subtopics in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification and was issued in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) final rule published in August 2018 that updated and simplified disclosure requirements that it believed were outdated, superseded, overlapping, duplicative and redundant. The new guidance is intended to align GAAP requirements with those of the SEC for all entities. The date on which the SECs removal of the related disclosure requirement became effective Prospective This standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements 91 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted by the Company as of December 31, 2023: Standard Description Date of Adoption Application Estimated Effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Reporting The guidance in this standard expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Additionally, the guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit and loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and other disclosure requirements. January 1, 2024, effective for fiscal year 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning in 2025 Retrospective The Company is evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The guidance in this standard requires disclosure of a tax rate reconciliation table, in both percentages and reporting currency amounts, which includes additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes and provides further details about reconciling items in certain categories that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires an annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes paid, and further disaggregated by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The standard includes other disclosure requirements and eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements. January 1, 2025 Prospective, with retrospective application also permitted The Company is evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to conform to the current presentation. Note 3: Regulatory Matters General Rate Cases Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that became effective during 2023: Effective Date Amount General rate cases by state: Missouri May 28, 2023 $ 44 Virginia April 24, 2023 (a) 11 Pennsylvania January 28, 2023 138 Illinois January 1, 2023 67 California, Step Increase January 1, 2023 13 Total general rate case authorizations $ 273 (a) Interim rates were effective May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates were subject to refund. The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued its final Order on April 24, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a decision on the cost of capital application for the Companys California subsidiary, which authorized a return on equity of 8.98 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 57.04 % for the three-year period from 2022 to 2024. The CPUCs decision was effective from the date of the order through the end of 2024. The decision included a Water Cost of Capital Mechanism (the WCCM) that allows the California subsidiary to increase its return on equity for the remainder of 2023 and 2024 based on capital market rates. As authorized by the WCCM, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC staff advice letters to increase the return on equity. On July 25, 2023, the CPUC staff approved a return on equity of 9.50 %, effective July 31, 2023. On November 15, 2023, the CPUC staff approved a return on equity of 10.20 %, effective January 1, 2024. 92 Table of Contents On May 3, 2023, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order approving the March 3, 2023, joint settlement agreement in the general rate case filed on July 1, 2022, by the Companys Missouri subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $ 44 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues, excluding $ 51 million in previously approved infrastructure surcharges, and authorized implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective May 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Missouri subsidiarys 2021 rate case order. The Missouri subsidiarys view of its rate base was $ 2.3 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) was 9.75 % and 50.0 %, respectively. On April 24, 2023, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order approving the settlement of the rate case filed on September 26, 2022, by the Companys Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $ 11 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues. Interim rates in this proceeding were effective on May 1, 2022, and the order required that the difference between interim and the final approved rates were subject to refund within 90 days of the order issuance. The order approves the settlement terms with a return on equity of 9.7 % and a common equity ratio of 40.7 %. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Virginia subsidiarys 2020 rate case order that have been completed or were planned through April 30, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order includes recovery of the Virginia subsidiarys COVID-19 deferral balance. It also includes approval of the accounting deferral of deviations in pension and other postretirement benefits expense from those established in base rates, until the Virginia subsidiarys next base rate case. On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the PaPUC) issued an order approving the joint settlement agreement in the rate case filed on April 29, 2022, by the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $ 138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues, excluding $ 24 million for previously approved infrastructure filings, and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective January 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiarys 2021 rate case order that were completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery of the Pennsylvania subsidiarys COVID-19 deferral balance. The Pennsylvania subsidiarys view of its rate base was $ 5.1 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) was 10.0 % and 44.8 %, respectively. On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on February 10, 2022, by the Companys Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiarys June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $ 83 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $ 67 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $ 18 million, effective January 1, 2023, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.78 %, authorized rate base of $ 1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0 % and a debt ratio of 51.0 %. The annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiarys 2017 rate case order that have been completed or were planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. Pending General Rate Case Filings On January 25, 2024, the Companys Illinois subsidiary filed tariffs for new water and wastewater rates. The request seeks a two-step rate increase consisting of aggregate annualized incremental revenue, based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75 %, of (i) approximately $ 136 million effective January 1, 2025, based on a future test year through December 31, 2025 with average rate base and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.27 % and a debt component of 47.73 %, and (ii) approximately $ 16 million effective January 1, 2026, based on a future test year to include end of period rate base and a capital structure with an equity component of 54.43 % and a debt component of 45.57 %. The requested increases are driven primarily by an estimated $ 557 million in capital investments to be made by the Illinois subsidiary starting January 2024 through December 2025. The request also proposes a treatment and compliance rider to address recovery of future environmental compliance investments, and a modification to the existing volume balancing account mechanism to include full production cost recovery. On January 19, 2024, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $ 162 million in additional annualized revenues, whic h is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 56.30 % and a debt component of 43.70 %. The requested annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by approximately $ 1.3 billion in capital investments made and to be made by the New Jersey subsidiary through December 2024. The request also proposes a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks a deferral of certain production cost adjustments. 93 Table of Contents On December 15, 2023, the Companys California subsidiary submitted a request to delay by one year its cost of capital filing and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2025. On February 2, 2024, the CPUC granted the request for a one year extension of the cost of capital filing to May 1, 2025, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2026. On November 8, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $ 204 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding projected infrastructure surcharges of $ 20 million. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.95 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 55.30 % and a debt component of 44.70 %. The requested annualized incremental revenue increase is driven primarily by an estimated $ 1.0 billion of incremental capital investments to be made through mid-2025. The request also proposes a mechanism to address compliance with evolving environmental requirements, such as emerging federal regulations for lead and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. If approved, the new rates would be expected to take effect on August 7, 2024. On November 1, 2023, the Companys Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $ 20 million in additional annualized revenues. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.95 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 45.67 % and a debt and other component of 54.33 %. The requested increase is driven by approximately $ 110 million in capital investments between May 2023 and April 2025. The request also proposed a revenue decoupling mechanism and seeks deferral of certain production cost adjustments. Interim rates will be effective May 1, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. On June 30, 2023, the Companys Kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $ 26 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharges of $ 10 million. The request is based on a proposed return on common equity of 10.75 % and a proposed capital structure with a common equity component of 52.45 %. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2024. On May 1, 2023, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $ 45 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding previously approved infrastructure surcharges of $ 7 million. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.50 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.80 %. The general rate case includes a future test year capturing planned investment through 2025 and an order is expected to be issued by February 25, 2024. On June 30, 2023, the West Virginia subsidiary filed its annual infrastructure surcharge requesting $ 8 million in additional annualized revenues for planned investment through 2024. The infrastructure surcharge will be aligned with the investments recognized in the general rate case if the future test year is approved. On March 31, 2023, the Companys Indiana subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $ 87 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding $ 41 million of revenue from infrastructure filings already approved, which includes three step increases, with $ 43 million of the increase to be included in rates in January 2024, $ 18 million in May 2024, and $ 26 million in May 2025. The requested adjustment is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.60 % and a capital structure with an equity component of 56.20 %. Hearings were completed in September and an order is expected in the general rate case by the end of February 2024. On July 1, 2022, the Companys California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $ 56 million and a total increase in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $ 95 million, all as compared to 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to capture the authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the Companys sales and associated variable expense forecast. The revised filing requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 of $ 37 million, compared to 2023 revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $ 20 million and $ 19 million, respectively. The total revenue requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is $ 76 million. On November 17, 2023, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC a partial settlement agreement reached with the CPUCs Public Advocates Office, which would determine the amount of incremental annualized water and wastewater revenue to be received by the California subsidiary to be $ 20 million in the 2024 test year, $ 16 million in the 2025 escalation year, and $ 15 million in the 2026 attrition year . The partial settlement agreement addresses the California subsidiarys revenue requirement request but does not address rate design or certain other matters, such as the requested inclusion and implementation of a revenue stability mechanism to separate the California subsidiarys revenue and water sales. New rates would be implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon a final decision issued by the CPUC approving the partial settlement agreement and resolving the other issues not addressed by the partial settlement agreement, which is expected to occur in mid-2024. 94 Table of Contents Infrastructure Surcharges A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2023: Effective Date Amount Infrastructure surcharges by state: New Jersey (a) $ 32 Kentucky October 1, 2023 4 Indiana (b) 26 Missouri January 16, 2023 14 Pennsylvania January 1, 2023 3 West Virginia January 1, 2023 7 Total infrastructure surcharge authorizations $ 86 (a) In 2023, $ 15 million was effective October 30, $ 1 million was effective June 29 and $ 16 million was effective April 29. (b) In 2023, $ 20 million was effective March 23 and $ 6 million was effective March 8. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective on or after January 1, 2024: Effective Date Amount Infrastructure surcharge filings by state: Missouri January 20, 2024 $ 26 Illinois January 1, 2024 5 Total infrastructure surcharge filings $ 31 Pending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings On January 31, 2024, the Companys Iowa subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $ 1 million in additional annualized revenues. Other Regulatory Matters In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Companys California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would have become effective upon receiving an order in the current pending rate case. On October 5, 2020, the Companys California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUCs denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Companys California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiarys petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporations revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Companys California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its pending 2022 general rate case, which, if adopted, will become effective upon receiving an order in the current pending rate case. 95 Table of Contents On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Companys New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $ 29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfields water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJs initial decision without modification. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4, 2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively. Oral argument was held on March 22, 2023, and the decision remains pending. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPUs order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory Assets Regulatory assets represent costs that are probable of recovery from customers in future rates. Approximately 50 % of the Companys total regulatory asset balance at December 31, 2023, earns a return. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory assets as of December 31: 2023 2022 Deferred pension expense $ 308 $ 251 Removal costs recoverable through rates 322 307 Unamortized debt expense 82 76 Regulatory balancing accounts 81 87 Other 313 269 Total regulatory assets $ 1,106 $ 990 The Companys deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $ 300 million and $ 251 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of authorized amounts which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates. Removal costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs. Unamortized debt expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt issuance costs, are deferred and amortized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates. Regulatory balancing accounts accumulate differences between revenues recognized and authorized revenue requirements until they are collected from customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs, purchased power and water accounts, dam removal costs and other cost balancing mechanisms. Other regulatory assets include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, customer owned lead service line removal costs, purchase premiums recoverable through rates, tank painting costs, certain construction costs for treatment facilities, property tax stabilization, employee-related costs, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs among others. These costs are deferred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods. The Company has current regulatory assets of $ 13 million and $ 40 million included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 96 Table of Contents Regulatory Liabilities Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, if costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory liabilities as of December 31: 2023 2022 Income taxes recovered through rates $ 1,064 $ 1,127 Removal costs recovered through rates 254 275 Postretirement benefit liability 85 100 Other 78 88 Total regulatory liabilities $ 1,481 $ 1,590 Income taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will be refunded to the Companys customers. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Companys deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (EADIT) will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. All of the Companys regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and crediting customers. Removal costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer rates over the lives of the associated assets. Postretirement benefit liability includes a portion of the over-funded status that is probable of refund through rates in future periods. The remaining portion represents prior service credits resulting from announced plan amendments which changed benefits for certain union and non-union plan participants. Other regulatory liabilities include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, TCJA reserves on revenue, pension and other postretirement benefit balancing accounts, legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts. The Company has current regulatory liabilities of $ 1 million and $ 5 million included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 97 Table of Contents Note 4: Revenue Recognition Disaggregated Revenues Presented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2023: Revenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues Regulated Businesses: Water services: Residential $ 2,143 $  $ 2,143 Commercial 798  798 Fire service 158  158 Industrial 167  167 Public and other 274  274 Total water services 3,540  3,540 Wastewater services: Residential 228  228 Commercial 62  62 Industrial 8  8 Public and other 29  29 Total wastewater services 327  327 Miscellaneous utility charges 35  35 Alternative revenue programs  10 10 Lease contract revenue  8 8 Total Regulated Businesses 3,902 18 3,920 Other 315 ( 1 ) 314 Total operating revenues $ 4,217 $ 17 $ 4,234 (a) Includes revenues associated with alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP. 98 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2022: Revenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues Regulated Businesses: Water services: Residential $ 1,938 $ 3 $ 1,941 Commercial 709 1 710 Fire service 147  147 Industrial 152 1 153 Public and other 252  252 Total water services 3,198 5 3,203 Wastewater services: Residential 173 1 174 Commercial 45  45 Industrial 4  4 Public and other 19  19 Total wastewater services 241 1 242 Miscellaneous utility charges 36  36 Alternative revenue programs  15 15 Lease contract revenue  9 9 Total Regulated Businesses 3,475 30 3,505 Other 288 ( 1 ) 287 Total operating revenues $ 3,763 $ 29 $ 3,792 (a) Includes revenues associated with provisional rates, alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP. 99 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2021: Revenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues Regulated Businesses: Water services: Residential $ 1,935 $  $ 1,935 Commercial 676  676 Fire service 151  151 Industrial 141  141 Public and other 230  230 Total water services 3,133  3,133 Wastewater services: Residential 151  151 Commercial 37  37 Industrial 4  4 Public and other 16  16 Total wastewater services 208  208 Miscellaneous utility charges 26  26 Alternative revenue programs  9 9 Lease contract revenue  8 8 Total Regulated Businesses 3,367 17 3,384 Other 547 ( 1 ) 546 Total operating revenues $ 3,914 $ 16 $ 3,930 (a) Includes revenues associated with alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP. Contract Balances Contract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In MSG, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition and are reclassified to accounts receivable when billed and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advances from customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts, and are recognized as revenue when the associated performance obligations are satisfied. Contract assets of $ 95 million, $ 86 million and $ 71 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were $ 87 million of contract assets added during 2023, and $ 78 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2023. There were $ 161 million of contract assets added during 2022, and $ 146 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2022. Contract liabilities of $ 63 million, $ 91 million and $ 19 million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were $ 103 million of contract liabilities added during 2023, and $ 131 million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2023. There were $ 189 million of contract liabilities added during 2022, and $ 117 million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2022. 100 Table of Contents Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations (RPOs) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As of December 31, 2023, the Companys O&M and capital improvement contracts in MSG and the Contract Services Group have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for work on military installations expire between 2051 and 2073 and have RPOs of $ 7.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S. government, prior to the agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2026 and 2038 and have RPOs of $ 612 million as of December 31, 2023, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Companys long-term contracts to operate and maintain the federal governments, a municipalitys or other partys water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized when the maintenance is performed. Note 5: Acquisitions and Divestitures Regulated Businesses Closed Acquisitions During 2023, the Company closed on 23 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $ 77 million, which added approximately 18,100 water and wastewater customers. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $ 81 million and liabilities assumed totaled $ 4 million. This includes the Companys New Jersey subsidiarys acquisition of t he water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City on June 1, 2023, for a cash purchase price of $ 22 million , $ 2 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in March 2021 in conne ction with the execution of the acquisition agreement. Five of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations and the assets acquired consisted primarily of utility plant. The preliminary purchase price allocations related to acquisitions accounted for as business combinations will be finalized once the valuation of assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their acquisition date. During 2022 , the Company closed on 26 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $ 335 million , of which $ 315 million was funded in 2022, including the acquisition of the City of York wastewater system assets noted below . Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $ 337 million and liabilities assumed totaled $ 6 million . Several of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. On May 27, 2022, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the public wastewater collection and treatment system assets from the York City Sewer Authority and the City of York for a purchase price of $ 235 million, in cash, $ 20 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in April 2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement. The system assets serve, directly and indirectly through bulk contracts, more than 45,000 customers. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price allocation consisted primarily of $ 231 million of utility plant and $ 4 million of goodwill, which is reported in the Companys Regulated Businesses segment. The pro forma impact of the Companys acquisitions was not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Pending Acquisitions On April 6, 2023, the Companys Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment plant from Granite City for an amended purchase price of $ 86 million. This plant provides wastewater service for approximately 26,000 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the first quarter of 2024. Effective March 24, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the rights to buy the wastewater system assets of the Township of Towamencin, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 104 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater services to approximately 6,300 customer connections in seven townships in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Company expects to close this acquisition in late 2024 or early 2025, pending final regulatory approval. 101 Table of Contents On October 11, 2022, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the public wastewater collection and treatment system assets (the System Assets) from the Butler Area Sewer Authority. On November 9, 2023, the PaPUC approved a settlement agreement without modification with respect to the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiarys application to acquire the System Assets from the Butler Area Sewer Authority for a purchase price of $ 230 million, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater service for approximately 15,000 customer connections. On December 14, 2023, Center Township and Summit Township filed appeals with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court seeking to reverse the order entered by the PaPUC approving the sale of the System Assets. On December 29, 2023, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed applications with the Commonwealth Court seeking to dismiss the appeals and requesting expedited consideration. By order dated February 1, 2024, the Commonwealth Court deferred deciding the application to dismiss the appeals and directed that the issues raised by the applications to dismiss are to be considered as part of the merits of the appeals. The order also granted expedited consideration and directed the case to be included on the next available list and established a briefing schedule. Based on the courts schedule, the Company estimates that the disposition of the appeals could occur as soon as the second quarter of 2024. Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc. On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (Liberty), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Companys New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $ 608 million in cash. The Companys regulated New York operations represented approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. Sale of Michigan American Water Company On February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for $ 6 million in cash. Sale of Homeowner Services Group On December 9, 2021 (the Closing Date), the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary (the Buyer) of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm, for total consideration of approximately $ 1.275 billion, resulting in pre-tax gain of $ 748 million. The consideration at closing was comprised of $ 480 million in cash, a secured seller promissory note payable in cash and issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $ 720 million, with an interest rate of 7.00 % per year, and a contingent cash payment of $ 75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $ 20 million, which is included in Gain on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recognized $ 50 million of interest income during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, from the secured seller note. On February 2, 2024, the secured seller note was amended to increase the principal amount from $ 720 million to $ 795 million, in full satisfaction of the $ 75 million contingent cash payment payable under the HOS sale agreement. In addition, the interest rate payable on the secured seller note has increased from 7.00 % per year to 10.00 % per year until maturity. The secured seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants. Certain of these covenants have been amended, including to provide for annual reductions of specified debt incurrence ratios. Furthermore, the amendment to the secured seller note eliminated the conditional right, beginning December 9, 2024, to require a repayment, without premium or penalty, of 100 % of the outstanding principal amount in full in cash together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other obligations thereunder. The final maturity date of the secured seller note remains December 9, 2026. The $ 75 million additional principal under the secured seller note must be repaid in full, without premium or penalty, in the event a proposed acquisition of a complementary business by or on behalf of an affiliate of the Buyer is not completed by May 2, 2024. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note are secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The secured seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyers election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the secured seller note in breach of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the secured seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from 105.5 % to 107.5 % of the outstanding principal amount of the loan and a customary make-whole payment. 102 Table of Contents Note 6: Property, Plant and Equipment Presented in the table below are the major classes of property, plant and equipment by category as of December 31: 2023 2022 Range of Remaining Useful Lives Weighted Average Useful Life Utility plant: Land and other non-depreciable assets $ 293 $ 239 Sources of supply 1,081 1,003 10 to 127 years 46 years Treatment and pumping facilities 4,594 4,298 3 to 101 years 39 years Transmission and distribution facilities 13,900 12,971 6 to 128 years 68 years Services, meters and fire hydrants 5,696 5,162 5 to 90 years 32 years General structures and equipment 2,512 2,289 1 to 109 years 16 years Waste collection 1,719 1,539 5 to 113 years 57 years Waste treatment, pumping and disposal 1,191 1,129 2 to 153 years 37 years Construction work in progress 1,040 974 Other plant 24 23 Total utility plant 32,050 29,627 Nonutility property 139 109 3 to 50 years 12 years Total property, plant and equipment $ 32,189 $ 29,736 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense amounted to $ 617 million , $ 552 million and $ 550 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively and was included in depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate average depreciable asset balances was 2.68 %, 2.60 % and 2.77 % for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the Company had capital expenditures acquired on account but unpaid of $ 399 million and $ 330 million included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In connection with the Companys capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) determined that the Company was qualified to receive $ 161 million in tax credits over a 10-year period. The Company is required to meet various annual requirements, including the maintenance of qualified full-time positions at the qualified business facility, in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15. In December 2022 and March 2023, the NJEDA issued the utilization certificates for the 2019 and 2020 tax credits, respectively, to the Company in the amount of $ 16 million each. The Company sold these tax credits to external parties for $ 15 million each. The loss on the sales of the tax credits was recorded to Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had assets of $ 32 million and $ 48 million, respectively, in other current assets and $ 90 million and $ 97 million, respectively, in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of these tax credits. In 2023, the Company reduced net realizable value of the future tax credit receivable by approximately $ 7 million as the Company does not expect it will be eligible for the full amount of the tax credit resulting from lower than required eligible headcount in the future. In January 2024, the NJEDA issued the utilization certificate for the 2021 tax credit to the Company in the amount of $ 16 million. The Company sold this tax credit to an external party for $ 15 million. The loss on the sale of the tax credit will be recorded to Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company has made the necessary annual filing for the year ended December 31, 2022, and expects to make the 2023 filing in April 2024, prior to the required filing deadline. The submitted filing is under review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in 2024. 103 Table of Contents Note 7: Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Presented in the table below are the changes in the allowances for uncollectible accounts for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Balance as of January 1 $ ( 60 ) $ ( 75 ) $ ( 60 ) Amounts charged to expense ( 24 ) ( 24 ) ( 37 ) Amounts written off 28 27 35 Other, net (a) 5 12 ( 13 ) Balance as of December 31 $ ( 51 ) $ ( 60 ) $ ( 75 ) (a) This portion of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is primarily related to COVID-19 related regulatory asset activity.

Note 8: Goodwill Goodwill Presented in the table below are the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Regulated Businesses Other Consolidated Cost Accumulated Impairment Cost Accumulated Impairment Cost Accumulated Impairment Total Net Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ 3,466 $ ( 2,332 ) $ 113 $ ( 108 ) $ 3,579 $ ( 2,440 ) $ 1,139 Goodwill from acquisitions 4    4  4 Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 3,470 $ ( 2,332 ) $ 113 $ ( 108 ) $ 3,583 $ ( 2,440 ) $ 1,143 Goodwill from acquisitions        Balance as of December 31, 2023 $ 3,470 $ ( 2,332 ) $ 113 $ ( 108 ) $ 3,583 $ ( 2,440 ) $ 1,143 The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30, 2023, which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated Businesses and MSG reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were no factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30, 2023. In 2023, there were no additions or impairments to the Companys goodwill. In 2022, the Company acquired goodwill of $ 4 million associated with one of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment. Note 9: Shareholders  Equity Common Stock Offering On March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of parent company common stock. Upon closing of this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $ 1,688 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of American Water Capital Corp. (AWCC), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, and for general corporate purposes. Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan Under the Companys dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the DRIP), shareholders may reinvest cash common stock dividends and purchase additional shares of Company common stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without paying brokerage commissions. Shares purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Companys election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 4.1 million shares available for future issuance under the DRIP. 104 Table of Contents Anti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program In February 2015, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time. The Company did no t repurchase shares of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023, there were 5.1 million shares of common stock available for purchase under the program. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Presented in the table below are the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Defined Benefit Plans Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedge Gain (Loss) on Fixed-Income Securities Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status Amortization of Prior Service Cost Amortization of Actuarial Loss Beginning balance as of January 1, 2022 $ ( 107 ) $ 1 $ 67 $ ( 6 ) $  $ ( 45 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification 14   5  19 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   3   3 Net other comprehensive income (loss) 14  3 5  22 Ending balance as of December 31, 2022 $ ( 93 ) $ 1 $ 70 $ ( 1 ) $  $ ( 23 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification ( 3 )   ( 8 ) 4 ( 7 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   4   4 Net other comprehensive income (loss) ( 3 )  4 ( 8 ) 4 ( 3 ) Ending balance as of December 31, 2023 $ ( 96 ) $ 1 $ 74 $ ( 9 ) $ 4 $ ( 26 ) The Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to net income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 15Employee Benefits for additional information. The amortization of the gain (loss) on cash flow hedges is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Dividends and Distributions The Companys Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Companys subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect distributions from, and repayments of indebtedness of, the Companys subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors. The Companys dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Companys income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared, they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record as of a date less than 30 days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on the Companys common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid. 105 Table of Contents During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company paid $ 532 million, $ 467 million and $ 428 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below is the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 December $ 0.7075 $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 September $ 0.7075 $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 June $ 0.7075 $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 March $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 $ 0.5500 On December 6, 2023, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $ 0.7075 per share payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2024. Under applicable law, the Companys subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the amount of the dividend that the subsidiary can pay. The ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends, make other upstream distributions or repay indebtedness to parent company or AWCC, the Companys wholly owned financing subsidiary, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, tax and other laws, regulatory restrictions and financial and other contractual obligations, including, for example, (i) regulatory capital, surplus or net worth requirements, (ii) outstanding debt service obligations, (iii) requirements to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries. Regulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness The issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide these borrowings to the Regulated Businesses or parent company. PUC authorization is generally required for the regulated subsidiaries to incur long-term debt. The Companys regulated subsidiaries normally obtain these required PUC authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financing or refinancing of debt. Note 10: Stock Based Compensation The Company has granted stock units, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and employees pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2017 Omnibus Plan), approved by the Companys shareholders in May 2017. Stock units under the 2017 Omnibus Plan generally vest based on (i) continued employment with the Company (RSUs), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole or in part of stated performance-based goals (PSUs). A total of 7.2 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 6.1 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027. The Company had granted stock options, stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company under its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined above, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017. 106 Table of Contents The cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued. The value of stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period. All awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vesting period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is compared to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiture rates during 2023, 2022 and 2021. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and there were no stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Presented in the table below is the stock-based compensation expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 RSUs and PSUs $ 23 $ 26 $ 15 Nonqualified employee stock purchase plan 2 2 2 Stock-based compensation 25 28 17 Income tax benefit ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 4 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 19 $ 22 $ 13 There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Subject to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Federal income tax code, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company records the tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets. The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded throughout the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock Units During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continued employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years . The RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three-year service period. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i) 15 months after the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participants separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date. Presented in the table below is RSU and director stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2023: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share) Non-vested total as of December 31, 2022 51 $ 130.43 Granted 59 148.93 Vested ( 42 ) 148.17 Forfeited ( 4 ) 149.85 Non-vested total as of December 31, 2023 64 $ 134.61 As of December 31, 2023, $ 6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of 1.55 years. The total fair value of stock units and RSUs vested was $ 6 million, $ 6 million and $ 9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 107 Table of Contents During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The majority of PSUs vest ratably based on continued employment with the Company over the three-year performance period (the Performance Period). Distribution of the performance shares is contingent upon the achievement of one or more internal performance measures and, separately, a relative total shareholder return performance measure, over the Performance Period. Presented in the table below is PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share) Non-vested total as of December 31, 2022 231 $ 142.92 Granted 173 159.42 Vested ( 149 ) 161.25 Forfeited ( 10 ) 146.78 Non-vested total as of December 31, 2023 245 $ 143.26 As of December 31, 2023, $ 9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested PSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of 0.84 years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was $ 31 million, $ 24 million and $ 22 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. PSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. PSUs granted with a relative total shareholder return condition are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years . The expected term is three years and the risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. Presented in the table below are the weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and the weighted average grant date fair values of PSUs granted for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Expected volatility 25.45 % 29.69 % 28.59 % Risk-free interest rate 4.31 % 1.90 % 0.22 % Expected life (years) 3.0 3.0 3.0 Grant date fair value per share $ 168.00 $ 99.23 $ 229.22 The grant date fair value of PSUs that vest ratably and have market and/or performance conditions are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting method. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the ESPP) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (which excludes certain of the Companys executives) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of 85 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of a three-month purchase period. A total of 2.0 million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2023, there were 1.5 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued approximately 87,000 , 82,000 and 80,000 shares, respectively, under the ESPP. 108 Table of Contents Note 11: Long-Term Debt The Company obtains long-term debt through AWCC primarily to fund capital expenditures of the Regulated Businesses and to lend funds to parent company to refinance debt and for other purposes. Presented in the table below are the components of long-term debt as of December 31: Rate Weighted Average Rate Maturity 2023 2022 Long-term debt of AWCC: (a) Senior notesfixed rate 2.30 %- 8.27 % 3.85 % 2024-2051 $ 10,786 $ 9,765 Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 1.79 %- 3.88 % 3.07 % 2024-2031 188 189 Long-term debt of other American Water subsidiaries: Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 0.00 %- 5.50 % 2.15 % 2024-2051 729 749 Mortgage bondsfixed rate 6.35 %- 9.19 % 7.38 % 2024-2039 516 534 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 8.47 %- 9.75 % 8.64 % 2036 3 3 Long-term debt 3.89 % 12,222 11,240 Unamortized debt discount, net (b) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 18 ) ( 19 ) Less current portion of long-term debt ( 475 ) ( 281 ) Total long-term debt $ 11,718 $ 10,929 (a) This indebtedness is considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under such indebtedness. (b) Includes debt discount, net of fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting. All mortgage bonds and $ 720 million of the private activity bonds and government funded debt held by the Companys subsidiaries were collateralized as of December 31, 2023. Long-term debt agreements contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, AWCC from issuing debt secured by the Companys consolidated assets. Certain long-term note covenants require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization (each as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio as of December 31, 2023, was 0.56 to 1.00. In addition, the Company has $ 830 million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes at par value, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to certain restrictions, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.51 %. Presented in the table below are future sinking fund payments and debt maturities: Amount 2024 $ 475 2025 619 2026 1,478 2027 700 2028 868 Thereafter 8,082 109 Table of Contents Presented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2023: Company Type Rate Weighted Average Rate Maturity Amount AWCC Senior notesfixed rate 3.63 % 3.63 % 2026 $ 1,035 AWCC Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 3.70 %- 3.88 % 3.80 % 2028 86 Other American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debtfixed rate 0.00 %- 3.75 % 2.88 % 2025-2041 143 Total issuances $ 1,264 The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $ 16 million related to the above issuances.

AWCC received net proceeds of approximately $ 1,022 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCCs commercial paper obligations and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of AWCC and have the benefit of a support agreement from parent company, which serves as the functional equivalent of a guarantee by parent company of the obligations of AWCC under the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026 (the Maturity Date), unless earlier exchanged or repurchased. The Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 5.8213 shares of parent company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $ 171.78 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate of the Notes is subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture pursuant to which the Notes were issued (the Note Indenture). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2026, the Notes are exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the Note Indenture. On or after March 15, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods. Upon any exchange of the Notes, AWCC will (1) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and (2) pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of parent company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of such common stock, at AWCC's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of AWCCs exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being exchanged. AWCC may not redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes will have the right to require AWCC to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the Note Indenture, at a repurchase price of 100 % of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 110 Table of Contents One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of A or better. In November and December 2023, the Company entered into six treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $ 225 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2024. These treasury lock agreements terminate in September 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 4.24 %. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt. During 2022 and the first half of 2023, the Company entered into 11 treasury lock agreements, each with a term of 10 years, with notional amounts totaling $ 300 million. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In June 2023, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a net gain of $ 3 million included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. Note 12: Short-Term Debt Liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility, and, in the future, issuances of equity. AWCC maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which provides $ 2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On October 26, 2023, the termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCCs revolving credit facility was extended, as permitted by the terms of the credit agreement, from October 2027 to October 2028. The facility is used principally to support AWCCs commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $ 150 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $ 500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods, as to which one such extension request remains . As of December 31, 2023, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $ 75 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $ 2.50 billion available to fulfill the Companys short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Services and S&P Global Ratings then applicable credit rating on AWCCs senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. Short-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $ 180 million and $ 1,177 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, or net of discount $ 179 million and $ 1,175 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on AWCCs outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 5.51 % and 4.41 %, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months. 111 Table of Contents Presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31: 2023 Commercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a) Total availability $ 2,600 $ 150 $ 2,750 Outstanding debt ( 180 ) ( 75 ) ( 255 ) Remaining availability as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,420 $ 75 $ 2,495 (a) Total remaining availability of $ 2.50 billion as of December 31, 2023, was accessible through revolver draws. 2022 Commercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a) Total availability $ 2,600 $ 150 $ 2,750 Outstanding debt ( 1,177 ) ( 78 ) ( 1,255 ) Remaining availability as of December 31, 2022 $ 1,423 $ 72 $ 1,495 (a) Total remaining availability of $ 1.50 billion as of December 31, 2022, was accessible through revolver draws.

The ratio as of December 31, 2023, was 0.56 to 1.00. The Company does not have any material borrowings that are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under AWCCs revolving credit facility.

The state NOL carryforwards expire in 2024 through 2043. 113 Table of Contents The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for taxable years ended December 31, 2018 and prior. Presented in the table below are the changes in gross liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits: Amount Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ 140 Increases in current period tax positions 26 Decreases in prior period measurement of tax positions ( 8 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 158 Increases in current period tax positions 27 Decreases in prior period measurement of tax positions ( 37 ) Balance as of December 31, 2023 $ 148 The Companys tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. If the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2023, an unrecognized tax benefit of $ 9 million, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Companys effective tax rate. The Company had an immaterial amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Presented in the table below are the changes in the valuation allowance: Amount Balance as of January 1, 2021 $ 19 Decreases in current period tax positions ( 9 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 10 Increases in current period tax positions 1 Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 11 Increases in current period tax positions  Balance as of December 31, 2023 $ 11 Other Tax Matters On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) was signed into law. The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the companys average adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable corporation must make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. During 2023, the Company evaluated the potential impacts of the CAMT provision within the IRA and available guidance and determined that it did not exceed the $1 billion AFSI threshold and therefore was not subject to CAMT in 2023. 114 Table of Contents Note 15: Employee Benefits Overview of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. Benefits under the plans are based on the employees years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, are provided with a defined contribution plan that includes a 5.25 % of base pay Company-funded defined contribution account. The Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees. The Companys pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid at risk status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 3Regulatory Matters for additional information. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (AWPP), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as of December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, AWPP Inactive. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of the amendment, actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive are amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. The actuarial gains and losses associated with the AWPP will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service period for active participants. The Company remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets to reflect the amendment for each plan as of December 31, 2022. The Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002. The Companys policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of actively managed funds in the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, including equities and fixed income securities. Pension Plan Assets The investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a long-term horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the Companys securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets. The Company uses fair value for all classes of assets in the calculation of market-related value of plan assets. As of December 31, 2023, the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets include the AWPP and AWPP Inactive. 115 Table of Contents Presented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, by asset category: Asset Category Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (a) Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2023 Cash $ 56 $ 56 $  $  $  4 % Equity securities: U.S. large cap 134 23   111 9 % U.S. small cap 37 37    3 % International 235    235 16 % Real estate fund 132    132 9 % REITs 6    6  % Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 234 171 2  61 16 % Corporate bonds 531  531   38 % Mortgage-backed securities 8  8   1 % Municipal bonds 23  23   2 % Long duration bond fund 3    3  % Guarantee annuity contracts 32   32  2 % Total $ 1,431 $ 287 $ 564 $ 32 $ 548 100 % Asset Category Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) (a) Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient (b) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2022 Cash $ 36 $ 36 $  $  $  3 % Equity securities: U.S. large cap 142 2   140 10 % U.S. small cap 79 79    6 % International 386 2   384 27 % Real estate fund 154    154 11 % REITs 6    6  % Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 126 119 7   9 % Corporate bonds 418  418   30 % Mortgage-backed securities 8  8   1 % Municipal bonds 21  21   1 % Long duration bond fund 3    3  % Guarantee annuity contracts 34   34  2 % Total $ 1,413 $ 238 $ 454 $ 34 $ 687 100 % (a) There were no material changes during the period for the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Companys 2024 target pension plan asset allocation is 37 % equity securities and 63 % fixed income securities. The Companys 2023 target pension plan asset allocation was 37 % equity securities and 63 % fixed income securities. 116 Table of Contents Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets The Companys postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each trust. In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates the long-term, strategic asset allocations for these plans through asset liability studies and uses various analytics to determine the optimal asset allocation. Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. In December 2022, the Company completed plan amendments to spin-off and merge a portion of the American Water Retiree Welfare Plan (Retiree Welfare Plan), with and into the Companys medical plan for active employees (Active Medical Plan), in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (Bargained VEBA) trust. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of these changes, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of Active Medical Plan participants (Active VEBA). The transfer of these Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permitted access to approximately $ 194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. The Company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as permitted by accounting guidance. See Note 18Fair Value of Financial Information, for additional information on accounting for the assets as investments in debt and equity securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g., fixed income, equity, alternatives) or strategy for which they have been appointed. Investment management agreements and recurring performance and attribution analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plans targeted investment policy. In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially offsetting the related increase in the liabilities. Within equities, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the Bargained VEBA trust, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plans exposure to changes in interest rates. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if necessary. The Retiree Welfare Plan is funded by the Bargained VEBA trust, the Non-Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (Non-Bargained VEBA) trust, the Active VEBA trust, and the American Water Life Insurance Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (Life VEBA) Trust. 117 Table of Contents Presented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, by asset category: Asset Category Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2023 Bargained VEBA: Cash $ 4 $ 4 $  $  $  4 % Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 7 7    7 % Corporate bonds 86  86   85 % Municipal bonds 4  4   4 % Total bargained VEBA $ 101 $ 11 $ 90 $  $  100 % Active VEBA: Cash $ 2 $ 2 $  $  $  6 % Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 2 2    6 % Corporate bonds 26  26   82 % Municipal bonds 2  2   6 % Total Active VEBA $ 32 $ 4 $ 28 $  $  100 % Non-bargained VEBA: Cash $ 2 $ 2 $  $  $  2 % Equity securities: U.S. large cap 44 44    35 % International 30 30    24 % Fixed income securities: Municipal bonds 49  49   39 % Total non-bargained VEBA $ 125 $ 76 $ 49 $  $  100 % Total $ 258 $ 91 $ 167 $  $  100 % 118 Table of Contents Asset Category Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2022 Bargained VEBA: Cash $ 3 $ 3 $  $  $  2 % Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 131 72 59   97 % Long duration bond fund 1 1    1 % Total bargained VEBA $ 135 $ 76 $ 59 $  $  100 % Non-bargained VEBA: Cash $ 1 $ 1 $  $  $  1 % Equity securities: U.S. large cap 40 40    34 % International 29 29    25 % Fixed income securities: Municipal bonds 47  47   40 % Total non-bargained VEBA $ 117 $ 70 $ 47 $  $  100 % Life VEBA: Cash $ 2 $ 2 $  $  $  100 % Fixed income securities: Total life VEBA $ 2 $ 2 $  $  $  100 % Total $ 254 $ 148 $ 106 $  $  100 % The Companys 2024 target postretirement benefit plan asset allocation for the Bargained VEBA and Active VEBA is 100 % fixed income securities and for the Non-bargained VEBA is 60 % equity securities and 40 % fixed income securities. The Companys 2023 target postretirement benefit plan asset allocation for the Bargained VEBA and Life VEBA was 100 % fixed income securities and for the Non-bargained VEBA was 60 % equity securities and 40 % fixed income securities. Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value CashCash and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered cash and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1. Equity securities For equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Other equities, such as certain U.S. large cap and international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued to reflect the plan funds interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Since NAV is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds and/or limited partnerships, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions. 119 Table of Contents Fixed-income securitiesCertain U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. These securities are categorized as Level 2 because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded future and option positions are reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily. Exchange-traded futures and options, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Other U.S. Treasury securities are invested in commingled funds that may implement their investment strategies in a variety of ways which may include direct and/or indirect investment in securities and other instruments or assets (e.g., futures and swaps) or investment in units of other commingled funds. These funds are valued to reflect the plan funds interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Since NAV is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed daily, with no prior notice and without further restrictions. Real estate fundReal estate funds are an investment vehicle in the form of a limited partnership primarily focused in real estate investments and are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed quarterly, with 90 or less days of notice, subject to available cash. REITsREITs are invested in commingled funds primarily focused in publicly traded shares of real estate investment trusts. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan funds interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. REITs are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These investments can typically be redeemed daily, with no prior notice and without further restrictions. Guaranteed annuity contractsGuaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market values are determined by the provider, they are not highly observable and have been categorized as Level 3. 120 Table of Contents Benefit Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status Presented in the table below is a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for the two most recent years, for all plans combined: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2023 2022 2023 2022 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation as of January 1, $ 1,578 $ 2,294 $ 255 $ 342 Service cost 17 30 2 3 Interest cost 85 64 14 10 Plan participants' contributions   3 3 Plan amendments    6 Actuarial loss (gain) 67 ( 582 ) ( 4 ) ( 77 ) Divestiture  ( 86 )  ( 4 ) Settlements ( 3 )    Gross benefits paid ( 118 ) ( 142 ) ( 24 ) ( 28 ) Federal subsidy   1  Other adjustments ( 4 )    Benefit obligation as of December 31, $ 1,622 $ 1,578 $ 247 $ 255 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets as of January 1, $ 1,413 $ 1,991 $ 254 $ 538 Actual return on plan assets 93 ( 401 ) 22 ( 68 ) Employer contributions 46 39 3 12 Plan participants' contributions   3 3 VEBA transfer    ( 194 ) Divestiture  ( 74 )  ( 9 ) Settlements ( 3 )    Benefits paid ( 118 ) ( 142 ) ( 24 ) ( 28 ) Fair value of plan assets as of December 31, $ 1,431 $ 1,413 $ 258 $ 254 Funded value as of December 31, $ ( 191 ) $ ( 165 ) $ 11 $ ( 1 ) Amounts recognized on the balance sheet: Noncurrent asset $ 73 $ 75 $ 12 $  Current liability ( 2 ) ( 5 )   Noncurrent liability ( 262 ) ( 235 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 191 ) $ ( 165 ) $ 11 $ ( 1 ) Presented in the table below are the components of accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory assets that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit costs as of December 31: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net actuarial loss $ 340 $ 289 $ 30 $ 45 Prior service credit ( 8 ) ( 10 ) ( 115 ) ( 145 ) Net amount recognized $ 332 $ 279 $ ( 85 ) $ ( 100 ) Regulatory assets (liabilities) $ 300 $ 251 $ ( 85 ) $ ( 100 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 32 28   Total $ 332 $ 279 $ ( 85 ) $ ( 100 ) 121 Table of Contents Presented in the tables below are the aggregate projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: Projected Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets 2023 2022 Projected benefit obligation $ 952 $ 872 Fair value of plan assets 688 632 Accumulated Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets 2023 2022 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 875 $ 793 Fair value of plan assets 688 632 The accumulated postretirement plan assets exceed benefit obligations for the Companys other postretirement benefit plans, except for the Northern Illinois Retiree Welfare Plan, of which the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is inconsequential for all periods presented. Contributions The PPA requires that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being at risk and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The Companys qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the at risk funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plans funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements. Minimum funding requirements for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined by government regulations and not by accounting pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2024 to the qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances. Presented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2024 expected employer contributions: To plan trusts $ 44 $  To plan participants 2  Estimated Future Benefit Payments Presented in the table below are the net benefits expected to be paid from the plan assets or the Companys assets: Pension Benefits Other Benefits Expected Benefit Payments Expected Benefit Payments Expected Federal Subsidy Payments 2024 $ 119 $ 23 $ 1 2025 122 23 1 2026 123 23 1 2027 125 23 1 2028 125 22 1 2029-2033 617 96 3 Because the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits. 122 Table of Contents Assumptions Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Companys employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. Presented in the table below are the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Weighted average assumptions used to determine December 31 benefit obligations: Discount rate 5.18 % 5.58 % 2.94 % 5.22 % 5.60 % 2.90 % Rate of compensation increase 3.51 % 3.51 % 3.51 % N/A N/A N/A Medical trend N/A N/A N/A graded from graded from graded from 6.75 % in 2024 7.00 % in 2023 6.00 % in 2022 to 5.00 % in 2031 to 5.00 % in 2031 to 5.00 % in 2026 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost: Discount rate 5.58 % 2.94 % 2.74 % 5.60 % 2.90 % 2.56 % Expected return on plan assets 6.79 % 6.50 % 6.50 % 5.00 % 3.60 % 3.67 % Rate of compensation increase 3.51 % 3.51 % 3.51 % N/A N/A N/A Medical trend N/A N/A N/A graded from graded from graded from 7.00 % in 2023 6.00 % in 2022 6.25 % in 2021 to 5.00 % in 2031 to 5.00 % in 2026 to 5.00 % in 2026 NOTE N/A in the table above means assumption is not applicable. The discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans expected cash flows by matching the plans cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Companys pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company used a weighted average expected return on plan assets of 6.79 % to estimate its 2023 pension benefit costs, and an expected blended return based on weighted assets of 5.00 % to estimate its 2023 other postretirement benefit costs. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Companys mortality assumption utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table with the MP-2021 mortality improvement scale. 123 Table of Contents Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost Presented in the table below are the components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Components of net periodic pension benefit cost (credit): Service cost $ 17 $ 30 $ 36 Interest cost 85 64 64 Expected return on plan assets ( 94 ) ( 122 ) ( 126 ) Amortization of prior service (credit) cost ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 13 21 27 Settlements 1   Net periodic pension benefit cost (credit) $ 19 $ ( 10 ) $ ( 2 ) Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income: Current year actuarial (gain) loss $ 3 $ ( 14 ) $ 1 Amortization of actuarial loss ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Total recognized in other comprehensive income ( 1 ) ( 17 ) ( 3 ) Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income $ 18 $ ( 27 ) $ ( 5 ) Components of net periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost: Service cost $ 2 $ 3 $ 4 Interest cost 14 10 10 Expected return on plan assets ( 12 ) ( 19 ) ( 21 ) Amortization of prior service credit ( 31 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 2   Net periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost $ ( 25 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 39 ) Savings Plans for Employees The Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employees contribution, subject to certain limitations. Due to the Companys discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an additional 5.25 % of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The Companys 401(k) savings plan expenses totaled $ 14 million, $ 13 million and $ 14 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the Companys 5.25 % of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $ 17 million, $ 16 million and $ 16 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All of the Companys contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees. Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies Commitments have been made in connection with certain construction programs. The estimated capital expenditures required under legal and binding contractual obligations amounted to $ 902 million as of December 31, 2023. 124 Table of Contents The Companys regulated subsidiaries maintain agreements with other water purveyors for the purchase of water to supplement their water supply. Presented in the table below are the future annual commitments related to minimum quantities of purchased water having non-cancelable contracts: Amount 2024 $ 71 2025 70 2026 64 2027 57 2028 57 Thereafter 764 The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. See Note 4Revenue Recognition for additional information regarding the Companys performance obligations. Contingencies The Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has accrued approximately $ 6 million of probable loss contingencies and has estimated that the maximum amount of loss associated with reasonably possible loss contingencies associated with such actions, which can be reasonably estimated, is $ 3 million. For certain legal actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. The Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such legal actions, other than as described in this Note 16Commitments and Contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by the Companys West Virginia subsidiary (WVAWC). The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed, and service was restored that day to approximately 80 % of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20 % by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015, to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored by July 1, 2015, to all customers affected by this event. On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWCs facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage. In February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Courts order certifying the issues class. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. In July 2022, the Circuit Court entered an order again certifying a class to address at trial certain liability issues but not to consider damages. In August 2022, WVAWC filed another Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia Circuit Courts July 2022 order, which petition was denied on June 8, 2023. On August 21, 2023, the Circuit Court set a date of September 9, 2024, for a class trial on issues relating to duty and breach of that duty. The trial will not find class-wide or punitive damages. 125 Table of Contents The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. WVAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. Given the current stage of this proceeding, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any reasonably possible loss or a range of loss related to this proceeding. Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation On September 12, 2019, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary (TAWC), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019. On September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (Service Company and, together with TAWC and the Company, collectively, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the Tennessee Plaintiffs). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. On January 12, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs motion for class certification. On February 9, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed under Tennessee law. On September 21, 2023, the court upheld its prior ruling but gave the Tennessee Plaintiffs the option to file an amended class definition. On October 12, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs filed an amended class definition seeking certification of a business customer-only class. On December 1, 2023, TAWC filed a memorandum in opposition to the amended class definition. On January 18, 2024, the court heard oral argument on the motions but issued no decision. The court instead requested additional briefing and a second oral argument, deadlines for which have not yet been set. The Company and TAWC believe that TAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. TAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. Given the current stage of this proceeding, the Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of loss related to this proceeding. Mountaineer Gas Company Main Break During the afternoon of November 10, 2023, WVAWC was informed that an 8-inch ductile iron water main owned by WVAWC, located on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia and originally installed in approximately 1989, experienced a leak. In the early morning hours of November 11, 2023, WVAWC crews successfully completed a repair to the water main. A precautionary boil water advisory was issued the same day to approximately 300 WVAWC customers and ultimately lifted on November 12, 2023. On November 10, 2023, a break was reported in a low-pressure natural gas main located near the affected WVAWC water main, and an inflow of water into the natural gas main and associated delivery pipelines occurred. The natural gas main and pipelines are owned by Mountaineer Gas Company, a regulated natural gas distribution company serving over 220,000 customers in West Virginia (Mountaineer Gas). The resulting inflow of water into the natural gas main and related pipelines resulted in a loss of natural gas service to approximately 1,100 Mountaineer Gas customers, as well as water entering customer service lines and certain natural gas appliances owned or used by some of the affected Mountaineer Gas customers. Mountaineer Gas reported that restoration of natural gas service to all affected gas mains occurred on November 24, 2023. The timing, order and causation of both the WVAWC water main break and Mountaineer Gass main break are currently unknown and under investigation. To date, a total of four pending lawsuits have been filed against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC purportedly on behalf of customers in Charleston, West Virginia related to these incidents. On November 14, 2023, a complaint captioned Ruffin et al. v. Mountaineer Gas Company and West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of Mountaineer Gas residential and business customers and other households and businesses supplied with natural gas in Kanawha County, which lost natural gas service on November 10, 2023, as a result of these events. The complaint alleges, among other things, breach of contract by Mountaineer Gas, trespass by WVAWC, nuisance by WVAWC, violation of statutory obligations by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, and negligence by Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for loss of use of natural gas, annoyance, inconvenience and lost profits, as well as punitive damages. 126 Table of Contents On November 15, 2023, a complaint captioned Toliver et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all natural persons or entities who are citizens of the State of West Virginia and who are customers of WVAWC and/or Mountaineer Gas in the affected areas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass and strict liability, as well as breach of contract against Mountaineer Gas. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, annoyance and inconvenience and business losses, as well as punitive damages. On November 16, 2023, a complaint captioned Dodson et al. v. West Virginia American Water and Mountaineer Gas Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of all West Virginia citizens living between Pennsylvania Avenue south of Washington Street, and Iowa Street, who are customers of Mountaineer Gas. The complaint alleges against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC, among other things, negligence, nuisance, trespass, statutory code violations and unfair or deceptive business practices. The complaint seeks class-wide damages against Mountaineer Gas and WVAWC for property loss and damage, loss of use and enjoyment of property, mental and emotional distress, and aggravation and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages. On January 4, 2024, a fourth complaint, captioned Thomas v. West Virginia-American Water Company and Mountaineer Gas Company , was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County asserting similar allegations as those included in the Ruffin , Toliver and Dodson lawsuits (the first three lawsuits), with the addition of counts alleging unjust enrichment and violations of the West Virginia Human Rights Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. On November 17, 2023, the Ruffin plaintiff filed a motion to consolidate the first three lawsuits before a single judge in Kanawha County Circuit Court. That motion remains pending. On December 5, 2023, a complaint captioned Mountaineer Gas Company v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County seeking damages under theories of trespass, negligence and implied indemnity. The damages being sought related to the incident include, among other things, repair and response costs incurred by Mountaineer Gas and attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas. On December 14, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed a motion with the Supreme Court of West Virginia to transfer this case to the West Virginia Business Court. On December 29, 2023, WVAWC filed a joinder in the motion to transfer the case. WVAWC has also filed a partial motion to dismiss this lawsuit. These motions remain pending. On December 20, 2023, Mountaineer Gas filed answers to each of the first three lawsuits, which included cross-claims against WVAWC alleging that Mountaineer Gas is without fault for the claims and damages alleged in the lawsuits and WVAWC should be required to indemnify Mountaineer Gas for any damages and for attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Mountaineer Gas in the lawsuits. WVAWC has filed a partial motion to dismiss certain claims in the Ruffin, Toliver, Dodson and Thomas lawsuits and a motion to dismiss the cross-claims asserted against WVAWC therein by Mountaineer Gas. On January 30, 2024, a motion was filed with the West Virginia Supreme Court on behalf of the Toliver plaintiff to refer the four class action complaints and the Mountaineer Gas complaint to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel. On February 7, 2024, WVAWC filed a motion joining in that referral request. These motions remain pending. On December 6, 2023, WVAWC initiated a process whereby Mountaineer Gas customers could file claims with WVAWC and seek payment from WVAWC of up to $ 2,000 per affected household for the inconvenience arising from a loss of use of their appliances and documented out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the natural gas outage. As of January 31, 2024, a total of 412 Mountaineer Gas customers completed this claims process and were paid by WVAWC an average of approximately $ 1,500 each. In return, these customers were required to execute a partial release of liability in favor of WVAWC. On November 16, 2023, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (the WVPSC) issued an order initiating a general investigation into both the water main break and natural gas outages occurring in this incident to determine the cause or causes thereof, as well as breaks and outages generally throughout the systems of WVAWC and Mountaineer Gas and the utility practices of both utilities. Following a series of disagreements among the parties regarding the scope of discovery, the WVPSC closed the general investigation into both utilities and ordered a separate general investigation for each utility. The WVPSC focused the two general investigations away from the cause of the events and instead on the maintenance practices of each utility during and after the main breaks. On January 29, 2024, the Consumer Advocate Division of the WVPSC filed a motion to intervene in the WVAWC general investigation. WVAWC is cooperating with its general investigation. Both general investigations remain pending. 127 Table of Contents The Company and WVAWC believe that the causes of action and other claims asserted against WVAWC in the class action complaints and the lawsuit filed by Mountaineer Gas are without merit and that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to such claims, and WVAWC is defending itself vigorously in these litigation proceedings. Given the current stage of these proceedings and the general investigation, the Company and WVAWC are currently unable to predict the outcome of any of the proceedings described above, and the Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of loss related to this proceeding. Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Compliance with Orders to Reduce Carmel River DiversionsMonterey Peninsula Water Supply Project Under a 2009 order (the 2009 Order) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the SWRCB), the Companys California subsidiary (Cal Am) is required to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an order (the 2016 Order, and, together with the 2009 Order, the Orders) approving a deadline of December 31, 2021, for Cal Ams compliance with these prior orders. Cal Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the Water Supply Project), which includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes Cal Ams purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the GWR Project) between Monterey One Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the MPWMD). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Ams obligations under the Orders. Cal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $ 50 million in associated incurred costs, plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria. In September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUCs requirements for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUCs 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Ams cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $ 279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Ams actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Ams prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $ 241 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2023, related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $ 72 million in AFUDC. In September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Ams purchase of additional water from an expansion to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorized Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed facilities at approximately $ 62 million. Cal Am may seek recovery of amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally, the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Ams actual weighted average cost of debt for most of the facilities. On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUCs December 5, 2022, final decision, and on March 30, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision denying Cal Ams application for rehearing, but adopting its proposed AFUDC for already incurred and future costs. This decision also provided Cal Am the opportunity to serve supplemental testimony to increase its cost cap for certain of the Water Supply Projects extraction wells. The amended water purchase agreement and a memorandum of understanding to negotiate certain milestones related to the expansion of the GWR Project have been signed by the relevant parties. Further hearings were scheduled in a Phase 2 to this CPUC proceeding to focus on updated supply and demand estimates for the Water Supply Project, and Phase 2 testimony was completed in September 2022. On October 23, 2023, a status conference was held to determine procedural steps to conclude the proceeding, and further evidentiary hearings have been scheduled for March 2024. 128 Table of Contents While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the Orders, as well as relevant final decisions of the CPUC related thereto, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $ 112 million in aggregate construction costs, plus applicable AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision and its December 2022 final decision, as amended by its March 30, 2023 rehearing decision. Coastal Development Permit Application In 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the Marina Application) to the City of Marina (the City) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the Citys coastal zone. Members of the Citys Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the Citys code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the Original Jurisdiction Application) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staffs environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the Original Jurisdiction Application did not impact Cal Ams appeal of the Citys denial of the Marina Application, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application. In October 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to 6.4 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to 4.8 million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about 2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community. In November 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. In December 2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (MCWD), MCWDs groundwater sustainability agency, and the MPWMD jointly filed a petition for writ of mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of the slant wells. Cal Am is named as a real party in interest. On November 14, 2023, the court set an initial trial date of May 1, 2024. This matter remains pending. Following the issuance of the coastal development permit, Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Cal Am has complied with the diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2024 and future years may be impacted by a number of factors, including without limitation potential recurrence of drought conditions in California and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The Orders remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the Orders may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders. Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets  Potential Condemnation Local Agency Formation Commission Litigation The water system assets of Cal Am located in Monterey, California (the Monterey system assets) are the subject of a potential condemnation action by the MPWMD stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. In 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets total value plus adjustments would be approximately $ 513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. In 2020, the MPWMD certified a final environmental impact report, analyzing the environmental impacts of the MPWMDs project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. 129 Table of Contents In February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (LAFCO) seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMDs boundaries. In June 2021, LAFCOs commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. In December 2021, LAFCOs commissioners denied the MPWMDs application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. In April 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its decision to deny the MPWMDs application seeking approval to become a retail water provider. In June 2022, the court granted, with conditions, a motion by Cal Am to intervene in the MPWMDs lawsuit against LAFCO. In December 2022, the court sustained in part, and denied in part, demurrers that had been filed by LAFCO seeking to dismiss the MPWMDs lawsuit. On December 11, 2023, the Monterey County Superior Court issued a writ of mandate directing LAFCO to vacate and set aside its original denial of the MPWMDs application to serve as a retail water provider (in conjunction with its effort to acquire the Monterey water system assets) and to reconsider the application in compliance with all applicable law. The court held that LAFCO incorrectly applied two statutory standards and noted a lack of sufficient evidence to support certain of LAFCOs factual findings. As a result, the LAFCO denial has been nullified and LAFCO will be required to hold another hearing on the MPWMDs application. On February 8, 2024, and February 9, 2024, respectively, Cal Am and LAFCO each filed a notice of appeal with the California Court of Appeals regarding the Monterey County Superior Courts decision to issue the writ of mandate. Cal Am is evaluating potential additional actions to contest the writ of mandate and to seek to uphold LAFCOs denial of the MPWMDs application, including filing other challenges and/or making suitable presentations at a subsequent LAFCO rehearing. Potential Condemnation Actions by MPWMD Separate from the proceedings related to the MPWMDs application with LAFCO, by letter dated October 3, 2022, the MPWMD notified Cal Am of a decision to appraise the Monterey system assets and requesting access to a number of Cal Ams properties and documents to assist the MPWMD with such an appraisal. Cal Am responded by letter on October 24, 2022, denying the request for access, stating that the MPWMD does not have the right to appraise Cal Ams system without LAFCO approval to become a retail water provider. On April 28, 2023, Cal Am rejected an offer by the MPWMD to purchase the Monterey system assets for $ 448.8 million. Over the written and oral objections of Cal Am, at a hearing held on October 10, 2023, the MPWMD adopted a resolution of necessity to authorize it to file an eminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterey system assets. On December 15, 2023, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court seeking to condemn the Monterey system assets. While the Company cannot currently predict the outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes that, given existing legal precedent related to similar attempts by public agencies in California to take over water systems and its other defenses, Cal Am should be able to defend itself successfully against the MPWMDs eminent domain lawsuit. West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill On June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class action settlement (the Settlement) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the West Virginia Plaintiffs) arising out of the January 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement, WVAWC and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved. As of December 31, 2023, $ 0.5 million of the aggregate Settlement amount of $ 126 million remains reflected in accrued liabilities, and $ 0.5 million in an offsetting insurance receivable remains reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pending resolution of all asserted actual or potential claims associated with this matter. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities reflects the status of the liability and the offsetting insurance receivable reflected in other current assets, each as of December 31, 2023. 130 Table of Contents Note 17: Earnings per Common Share Presented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for the years ended December 31: 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 944 $ 820 $ 1,263 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstandingBasic 193 182 182 Effect of dilutive common stock equivalents    Weighted average common shares outstandingDiluted 193 182 182 The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted under the Companys 2007 Plan and outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted under the Companys 2017 Omnibus Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the ESPP. Less than one million share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. The if-converted method is applied to the Notes issued in June 2023 for computing diluted EPS. For all periods presented, there was no dilution resulting from the Notes. See Note 11Long-Term Debt for additional information relating to the Notes. Note 18: Fair Value of Financial Information Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments: Current assets and current liabilitiesThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values. Secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS  The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the secured seller promissory note, included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS is $ 720 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This amount represents the principal amount owed under the secured seller note, for which the Company expects to receive full payment. The accounting fair value measurement of the secured seller note approximated $ 704 million and $ 686 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accounting fair value measurement is an estimate that is reflective of changes in benchmark interest rates. The secured seller note is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. On February 2, 2024, the secured seller note from the sale of HOS was amended to increase the principal amount from $ 720 million to $ 795 million, in full satisfaction of a $ 75 million contingent cash payment. See Note 5Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information. Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debtThe fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs. Presented in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and the fair values of the Companys financial instruments: As of December 31, 2023 Carrying Amount At Fair Value L e vel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements $ 3 $  $  $ 3 $ 3 Long-term debt 12,190 9,575 1,044 757 11,376 131 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022 Carrying Amount At Fair Value L e vel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements $ 3 $  $  $ 3 $ 3 Long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) 11,207 8,599 49 1,427 10,075 Fair Value Measurements To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows: Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds. Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges. Level 3Unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds subject to purchase and sale restrictions. Recurring Fair Value Measurements Presented in the tables below are assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy: As of December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Restricted funds $ 34 $  $  $ 34 Rabbi trust investments 22   22 Deposits 8   8 Other investments Money market and other 26   26 Fixed-Income Securities 140 6  146 Total assets 230 6  236 Liabilities: Deferred compensation obligations 27   27 Mark-to-market derivative liability  8  8 Total liabilities 27 8  35 Total assets $ 203 $ ( 2 ) $  $ 201 132 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Restricted funds $ 32 $  $  $ 32 Rabbi trust investments 21   21 Deposits 7   7 Other investments Money market and other 61   61 Fixed-Income Securities 147 6  153 Contingent cash payment from the sale of HOS   72 72 Mark-to-market derivative asset  1  1 Total assets 268 7 72 347 Liabilities: Deferred compensation obligations 24   24 Total liabilities 24   24 Total assets $ 244 $ 7 $ 72 $ 323 Restricted fundsThe Companys restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects. Rabbi trust investmentsThe Companys rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement plan benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. DepositsDeposits include escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred compensation obligationsThe Companys deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Companys deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices. Mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilitiesThe Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of treasury lock agreements, classified as cash flow hedges, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows, which are discounted, to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility. Other investmentsAs a result of the Retiree Welfare Plan changes discussed in Note 15Employee Benefits, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of the Active VEBA. The transfer of these Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $ 194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. 133 Table of Contents The investments in the Active VEBA trust primarily consist of money market funds and available-for-sale fixed income securities. The money market and other investments have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The fair value measurement of the money market and other investments is based on observable market prices and therefore included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1. The available-for-sale fixed income securities are primarily investments in U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds. The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain U.S. Treasury securities are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, and are therefore categorized as Level 2, because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. The Company includes other investments measured and recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $ 62 million and $ 67 million in other current assets, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 111 million and $ 147 million in other long-term assets, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized. The following tables summarize the unrealized positions for available-for-sale fixed income securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: As of December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Basis Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair Value Available-for-sale fixed-income securities $ 143 $ 6 $ 3 $ 146 As of December 31, 2022 Amortized Cost Basis Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair Value Available-for-sale fixed-income securities $ 153 $  $  $ 153 The fair value of the Companys available-for-sale fixed income securities, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31, 2023, is as follows: Amount Other investments - Available-for-sale fixed-income securities Less than one year $ 83 1 year - 5 years 50 5 years - 10 years 4 Greater than 10 years 9 Total $ 146 Contingent cash payment from the sale of HOS The Companys contingent cash payment derivative included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS is included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The accounting fair value measurement of the contingent cash payment was $ 72 million as of December 31, 2022, which was reflective of changes in the benchmark interest rate and was estimated using the probability of the outcome of receipt of the $ 75 million, a Level 3 input. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent cash payment from the sale of HOS is accounted for as a receivable, as the conditions have been satisfied. The carrying amount of the receivable is included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as December 31, 2023, which approximates fair value. On February 2, 2024, the secured seller note from the sale of HOS was amended to increase the principal amount from $ 720 million to $ 795 million, in full satisfaction of the $ 75 million contingent cash payment. See Note 5Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information. Note 19: Leases The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one year to 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Companys sole discretion. Renewal options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Companys ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 36 years, five years , and five years , respectively. 134 Table of Contents The Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (Partners) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Company transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) issued by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30 to 40 years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment , as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Company at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $ 144 million and $ 145 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting, and as such, are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and excluded from the lease disclosure presented below. The Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners assets in performing under the O&M agreements. The O&M agreements are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $ 4 million in 2024 through 2028, and $ 41 million thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental expenses under operating leases were $ 11 million, $ 12 million and $ 13 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating cash flows from operating leases, was $ 11 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $ 11 million. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the operating leases was 17 years, and the weighted-average discount rate of the operating leases was 4 %. The future maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2023, were $ 10 million in 2024, $ 10 million in 2025, $ 9 million in 2026, $ 8 million in 2027, $ 6 million in 2028 and $ 76 million thereafter. At December 31, 2023, imputed interest was $ 39 million. Note 20: Segment Information The Companys operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Regulated Businesses segment is the largest component of the Companys business and includes subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 14 states. The Company also operates other businesses, primarily MSG, which provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities. These other businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within Other, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. The Companys former HOS business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2021, was included in Market-Based Businesses in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as Market-Based Businesses and Other have been combined and are shown as Other. Segment results for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment includes intercompany costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary to subsidiaries within Other, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by subsidiaries within Other to regulated subsidiaries. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Companys Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the secured seller promissory note from the sale of HOS, income from assets not associated with the Regulated Businesses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management. 135 Table of Contents Presented in the tables below is summarized segment information as of and for the years ended December 31: 2023 Regulated Businesses Other Consolidated Operating revenues $ 3,920 $ 314 $ 4,234 Depreciation and amortization 693 11 704 Total operating expenses, net 2,421 309 2,730 Interest expense ( 364 ) ( 96 ) ( 460 ) Interest income 28 45 73 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 259 ( 7 ) 252 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders 971 ( 27 ) 944 Total assets 27,480 2,818 30,298 Cash paid for capital expenditures 2,551 24 2,575 2022 Regulated Businesses Other Consolidated Operating revenues $ 3,505 $ 287 $ 3,792 Depreciation and amortization 633 16 649 Total operating expenses, net 2,242 277 2,519 Interest expense ( 314 ) ( 119 ) ( 433 ) Interest income 2 50 52 Gain on sale of businesses  19 19 Provision for income taxes 188  188 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders 854 ( 34 ) 820 Total assets 25,038 2,749 27,787 Cash paid for capital expenditures 2,284 13 2,297 2021 Regulated Businesses Other Consolidated Operating revenues $ 3,384 $ 546 $ 3,930 Depreciation and amortization 601 35 636 Total operating expenses, net 2,227 507 2,734 Interest expense ( 290 ) ( 113 ) ( 403 ) Interest income 1 3 4 (Loss) or gain on sale of businesses ( 1 ) 748 747 Provision for income taxes 172 205 377 Net income attributable to common shareholders 789 474 1,263 Total assets 23,365 2,710 26,075 Cash paid for capital expenditures 1,747 17 1,764 136 Table of Contents Note 21: Unaudited Quarterly Data Presented in the tables below are supplemental, unaudited, consolidated, quarterly financial data for each of the four quarters in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

=== ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ===

D PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and its directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2023, using the criteria described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the Companys evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) , its management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 138 Table of Contents ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION On February 8, 2024, Karl F. Kurz, the Companys Board Chair, was notified by Admiral James G. Stavridis of his decision to resign as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), effective as of February 12, 2024. Admiral Stavridiss notification stated that he was resigning to focus on all of his professional and personal obligations and that he did not have any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to the Companys operations, policies or practices. Admiral Stavridis had been a director of the Company since 2018 and served as Chair of the Safety, Environmental, Technology and Operations Committee (the SETO Committee) since 2021. At the effective time of his resignation, Admiral Stavridis also had served as a member of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Company wishes to thank Admiral Stavridis for his many years of service to the Board. On February 14, 2024, upon the recommendation of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the Board reduced the size of the Board from ten to nine members and appointed Board member Michael L.
